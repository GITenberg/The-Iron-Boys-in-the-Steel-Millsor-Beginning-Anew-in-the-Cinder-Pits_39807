<p class="center">TOO SLOW FOR HIM</p>


<p class="cap">THE telephone bell rang sharply. Its very
insistence seemed to indicate the nervous
haste of the person on the other end
of the line.</p>

<p>"Hello!" growled the boy, looking longingly
out of the office window as he clapped the receiver
to his ear. "What's that? What building?
Pity they couldn't pick out a hot day,
while they were about it. Yes, I'll tell him.
'Yes,' I said. Can't you hear?"</p>

<p>Several clerks, with coats and vests off, were
lounging about the office of the great steel works
in the accident department. The sun beat down
on the building with relentless energy, and there
was scarcely a breath of air stirring. There
was little incentive to work, and hardly any one
was making the slightest pretext at it.</p>

<p>Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis glanced inquiringly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
at the telephone operator. Being in the
accident department, they were interested every
time they heard the telephone bell ring. It was
their duty, immediately upon an accident being
reported in any of the mills, to proceed to the
scene at once and gather all the facts for the
future use of the company. Furthermore, they
were allowed considerable latitude in the disposal
of persons who had been injured.</p>

<p>"Anything doing?" questioned Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Accident," answered the operator in a tone
that led one to believe that the mere effort of
speaking gave him pain.</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Number twenty-four," meaning the building
bearing that number. "That's in your district,
Rush."</p>

<p>Bob Jarvis grinned.</p>

<p>"I am in luck that it isn't in my division. It's
hot enough here, but excuse me from going into
the mills on a day like this. Want any help,
Steve?"</p>

<p>"No, thank you. And besides, you are too
lazy to work to-day. You would only be a
handicap to me. What is the accident, did they
say?"</p>

<p>The operator shook his head wearily.</p>

<p>Steve Rush, picking up a pad of paper which
he stuffed in his pocket, hurried from the office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
and started across the street on a run. As he
did so he saw a red light burning dimly at the
peak of one of the long row of soot-blackened
mills that made up the plant of the Steelburgh
mills, a signal indicating that a disaster of some
sort had occurred in that building. Seeing that
signal it was the duty of the Iron and Steel
Police, who kept order in the mills, to report the
fact to the accident department at once.</p>

<p>Steve did not need the red light to guide him.
He was by this time familiar with the location
of all the buildings, though there were some,
such as the plate mills, where the armor plate
was made for the ships of the Navy, which he
had never entered. No one save those who were
employed there were able to gain admission to
the buildings where secret processes were employed.</p>

<p>Steve dashed by the guard at the gate.</p>

<p>"Here, where are you going?" demanded the
guard.</p>

<p>"Accident department."</p>

<p>"Let me see your card!" demanded the officious
gate guard.</p>

<p>"Some other time. Can't you see I am in a
hurry?" answered the lad, running past the
gate and into the yards at top speed.</p>

<p>The Iron and Steel Police like nothing better
than an opportunity to show their authority.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
The result was that Steve had gotten but a short
distance inside the yard when policemen, seeing
him running, began shouting at him from all
sides to halt. Perhaps they had seen him passing
in and out, daily, for several weeks. But
this made no difference. He was running, and
all persons going faster than a walk must have
a reason for so doing. It was their duty to stop
the runner and learn what it meant. At least,
that was the way these guardians of the mills
construed their duty.</p>

<p>Steve merely pointed to the red light high up
on number twenty-four, as the best answer to
their questions. He kept on running. So did
some of the policemen, but they were no match
in speed, for the supple young fellow, who realizing
the necessity for haste, kept on at top
speed.</p>

<p>As he neared the building, three uniformed
officers dodged out from behind a pile of steel
bars, their attention having been called to the
sprinter by the shouts of their companions.</p>

<p>"Hold up!"</p>

<p>"I can't!" answered Steve, continuing on
toward them.</p>

<p>"Ye'd better stop, if ye know what's good
for ye."</p>

<p>"There has been an accident. I can't stop.
I'm from the accident department, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"We'll stop ye!"</p>

<p>"The wooden-heads, they actually are going
to hold me up! Well, I'll teach them a lesson,
even if I lose my job for it," gritted the boy.
"Get out of the way, I tell you! Don't you
dare stop me here!"</p>

<p>The officers spread out a little, drawing their
clubs as they executed the movement, one stepping
forward a little in advance of the others.</p>

<p>"There's only one way out of it," muttered
Steve. "I've either got to get by them or be
called down at the office for being too slow. I
don't believe I'll be called down for being late
to-day. At least, not for anything that I see
just now."</p>

<p>The foremost of the Iron and Steel Police
made a grab for the fleeing lad, catching and
whirling the boy around, facing in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>"Let go of me!"</p>

<p>A firmer grip was the answer. Rush made
a quick turn. His right arm was thrust forcibly
against the neck of the policeman, followed by
a sudden kick on the shins. The policeman fell
flat on the cinder-covered ground.</p>

<p>The other two men sprang forward with
drawn clubs to attack the boy who had used
their companion so roughly. Their clubs were
raised to strike, but ere they could bring their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
weapons into use they too had dropped to the
ground.</p>

<p>"Now, maybe you'll learn to mind your own
business," shouted the boy, starting on a run
for the building over which the red light still
glowed. "The idiots! Why, a man cannot go
about his business without their interfering with
him. I wonder the company stands for such
idiotic nonsense."</p>

<p>Steve dashed in through the door of number
twenty-four, which also was guarded by a policeman.</p>

<p>"Accident department," said the boy as he
ran in, at which the officer nodded understandingly.
"He has some sense," breathed Steve.</p>

<p>The lad's quick eyes caught sight of a group
of men standing half way down the centre of
the dimly lighted building. It was the open-hearth
furnace building, and the group was a
little to the right of the furnaces that extended
down nearly through the centre.</p>

<p>Hurrying up to the group Rush elbowed his
way through to a point where he saw half a
dozen men lying on the floor groaning. The
foreman was there waiting, having sent for
an ambulance to convey the men to a place
where they could be treated.</p>

<p>"Burned?" questioned Steve sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Small ladle tipped over, spattering some
hot metal on them," replied the man, jerking
a thumb toward the suffering men.</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly how it happened."</p>

<p>The foreman did so with evident reluctance.
In the first place, an accident in his department
reflected on him and his management. Besides
this he was so used to seeing men injured, during
his long service in the steel mills, that the
sight of human suffering did not make the same
impression upon him that might otherwise have
been the case.</p>

<p>"Who else saw the accident?"</p>

<p>"All the men on the pit and ladles."</p>

<p>Steve quickly had the names of the witnesses
and made brief notes of their stories, after
which he returned to the foreman to get the
names of the injured men. By the time he had
completed this, only a few minutes elapsed before
the photographer arrived.</p>

<p>Steve pointed to the injured men, as indicating
that they were to be photographed first. Next
he turned his attention to the ladle that had been
capsized. He made a quick examination of this,
motioning to the foreman to join him.</p>

<p>"The chain broke, did it not?"</p>

<p>"You can see that one of them did," answered
the foreman gruffly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am asking you. No matter what I see.
How did it happen to break?"</p>

<p>"Too much strain on it, I suppose."</p>

<p>Rush picked his way gingerly around to the
other side, for the ground was covered with
metal that in some cases was still red hot.
Reaching a point where he could do so without
being burned he poked the broken chain about
with an iron bar that he had picked up, until he
got the break where he could see it more plainly.
There was a dull mark across the break, that
seemed especially to interest him. The dull
mark extended clear to the surface of the link.</p>

<p>"Photographer, I want a picture, first of this
break in the chain, and next a general view of
the upset ladle and chain. You had better use
a flash light on the link so your picture will
show the break plainly."</p>

<p>"Say, what do you want to do that for?" demanded
the foreman.</p>

<p>"What do I want to do that for?" repeated
the boy, turning sharply.</p>

<p>"Yes, no need to give a fellow away like that.
It was an accident."</p>

<p>"Bill Foley, what do you take me for? I'm
not that kind of man. I would help you if I
could, but I am paid for gathering all the facts
whenever an accident occurs. You are the foreman
of this open-hearth, and you ought to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
very first one to demand an honest investigation."</p>

<p>"It just broke, that's all. They're all likely
to do that."</p>

<p>"They are all supposed to be examined daily,
too," answered Rush quickly. "The company's
first care is for the safety of its men. Still, it's
not the part of my duty to preach to you."</p>

<p>"Then <i>don't</i>!" growled Foley.</p>

<p>"No; I'll do my duty, old chap, though in
this case it means some trouble for you."</p>

<p>Two ambulances had arrived by this time and
the surgeons were giving first aid to the injured
as the men lay stretched out on the still hot cinders
on the floor of the dingy mill.</p>

<p>The work of the mill had not ceased. It went
on with a rush and a roar, interspersed with
reverberating crashes, here and there, that
sounded as though the steel roof were caving in.</p>

<p>"Any of them seriously hurt, Doctor?" demanded
Steve.</p>

<p>"One is very badly burned. He won't get
well. As for the others, I can't promise."</p>

<p>"Should they all go to the hospital?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then take them there, please. Do you need
any more ambulances?"</p>

<p>"No; but I wish you would get some men to
carry these poor fellows to the ambulances."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Foley, will you please assign men as litter-bearers?"
requested Rush, turning to the foreman
of the open-hearth.</p>

<p>The foreman did so sullenly and grudgingly.</p>

<p>"They might better go home," he growled.
"You fellows are trying to make a mountain
out of a mole-hill."</p>

<p>Four men were assigned to the task, however,
and these, hurrying out, soon returned with two
litters. On them the injured men were placed
and in turn borne to the waiting ambulances,
in which they were tenderly placed. The first
ambulance, being filled, was hurried away to the
company's hospital, a few doors from the main
offices of the mills.</p>

<p>Steve pushed forward his inquiry with great
energy. There seemed nothing too trivial for
him to inquire about, if it could possibly bear
on the accident. So persistent were his inquiries,
into these accident cases, as to cause
those who were in any way responsible to feel
a sense of uneasiness the moment they saw the
lad enter their building. Rush spared no one
when that person was in any way to blame. He
did his work well and conscientiously, without
fear or favor. As a result he made many bitter
enemies as well as some life-long friends.</p>

<p>The men in the mills with whom he came in
contact in these hurried visits had come to regard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Steve as one among many. He did not side
with the bosses, and, though he was the friend
of the men, he did not side with them unless
their side chanced to be the right one.</p>

<p>The reader has already recognized in Steve
Rush and Bob Jarvis, the Iron Boys, who, as
told in "<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys in the Mines</span>," began
their career in the great industrial world, at the
foot of the deep shaft in the Cousin Jack Iron
Mine. It will be remembered that they distinguished
themselves there in the beginning by
their courage, resourcefulness and persistent efforts
to serve their employers in the best possible
manner. It was in this, their first employment,
that the Iron Boys became friends after
a fight and from that moment began a friendship
that was destined to last for years, in fact
as long as the lads lived. Their escapes from
death were many and thrilling, but because of
their courage and cool-headedness they came
safely through their apprenticeship, winning
promotion and the confidence and respect of
their employers.</p>

<p>Again, as narrated, in "<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys as
Foremen</span>," Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis met with
new and exciting experiences. They became, as
will be remembered, involved in a great strike,
and because of their fidelity to what they believed
to be the right, were expelled from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
union, even after they had by their heroic efforts
saved the mine from destruction by fire
and dynamite, and thus saved the lives of many
of their companions. The Iron Boys through
their further efforts exposed the leader of the
strike, proving him to be a dishonest man and
a rascal of the worst type, who, instead of working
for the interests of the honest but misguided
members of the union, was seeking power and
money, regardless of the suffering that his unworthy
ambition brought to others. In the end
the lads, after deeds of violence had been perpetrated,
saved the bridge that was the key to
the transportation of the company's product,
for all of which they were handsomely rewarded
by their grateful employers.</p>

<p>From the mines the Iron Boys took the next
step in their calling which they were determined
to learn from start to finish. This second step
had to do with the transportation of the ore
from the mines to the mills. It will be recalled
by readers of "<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys on the Great
Lakes</span>" that the lads shipped on an ore boat;
that they boarded the boat through an ore chute,
being dumped in the hold, and that they nearly
lost their lives before making their way to the
upper deck of the ship. Their first experience
on shipboard had to do with the fire room in
which they were put to work as stokers, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
where they had a most unique but desperate
battle with the "black gang" of the stoke hole.
Collision and shipwreck were a part of their
early experiences, during which Steve Rush and
his companion again proved themselves heroes.
And now, after a season on the Great Lakes,
they had moved on to the steel mills, where the
red ore that they had helped to take from the
depths of the earth was worked up into pig iron
and steel. The boys had declined to take letters
of introduction to the mills, proceeding
there like any one else and asking for jobs.</p>

<p>However, unknown to them, the president of
the mining company had written to Mr. Keating,
general superintendent of the mills, asking
the superintendent to give the boys the best
possible opportunity to learn the business. The
president had recounted some of their achievements,
so that, though they did not know it, the
superintendent was fully prepared for their
coming. He had taken a liking to the frank-faced,
athletic young fellows the moment he
first saw them. He saw in them the making of
splendid men. He reasoned, however, that their
rise would be quicker were they to start in the
offices of the company. It seemed too bad to
start them with the rank and file in the turbulent
mills, where hard, rough men toiled by day
and by night at their hard labor.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the strongest could survive, and Mr.
Keating, despite the athletic appearance of the
Iron Boys, did not believe they possessed the
endurance to stand up under the strain of work
in the mills.</p>

<p>That was where he underrated the staying
qualities of Bob and Steve. They had been
placed in the accident department, where they
had distinguished themselves almost at once. No
such clear and thorough reports had ever been
made of accidents in the mills as had been
turned in by Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis. But
Steve was not satisfied. There were some features
about the work that he did not like. In
the short time that he had been at the work he
had witnessed scenes that had stirred him profoundly.
Where his duty called him there was
always suffering, and in many cases, death.
Though the steel company did all in its power
to protect its men, accidents of the most harrowing
nature were bound to occur in that hazardous
calling. The Iron Boys could not hold
back or turn their heads at the sights they saw.
It was their duty to face the ordeal, and face
it they did.</p>

<p>Steve, after all the injured men had been
loaded into the ambulances, hurried out, leaped
to the tailboard of the last ambulance and went
rolling away toward the company's hospital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
He clung easily to the stanchions at the rear of
the swaying wagon, thinking over the facts he
had gained. The ambulance surgeon hummed
softly to himself, now and then casting an eye
over the moaning men who were being conveyed
to the hospital. The surgeon's mind, perhaps,
was far away and on more peaceful scenes.</p>

<p>"As soon as you have examined the men let
me know who is in the best condition to be
talked to," requested Rush, as the ambulance
driver pulled up before the hospital. "I must
get the stories of the men so far as possible."</p>

<p>The surgeon nodded. By the time Steve entered
the hospital the grime had been washed
from the faces of the burned men. Steve halted
as his eyes caught sight of a boy whose eyes
were fixed upon his own.</p>

<p>"Why, Ignatz Brodsky!" exclaimed the Iron
Boy. "I didn't know you were hurt."</p>

<p>The Polish boy, whom Steve had befriended
on several occasions, thus winning the lad's undying
devotion, nodded feebly.</p>

<p>"Are you suffering?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I die."</p>

<p>"Nonsense. Doctor, look after Brodsky here
as soon as you can, won't you?"</p>

<p>"I'll attend to him at once," answered the
surgeon. "Why, he isn't badly hurt. He will
be able to go home, perhaps by to-morrow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"There, what did I tell you, Ignatz? Of
course you are all right. I will tell your mother
how you are as soon as I can get away from
the mills. Is there anything you want me to
do for you besides that?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Are you able to tell me what you know about
the accident?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Ignatz, in halting tones, gave the investigator
a homely but graphic account of how the disaster
had occurred. In the first place, the men
had been to blame because they had no business
to be so near the small ladle of molten metal
when it was being hoisted from the pit. In the
second place, Ignatz said, that, after the accident,
he had heard some of the men talking
about the chain being defective. Steve secured
the names of these men from the Polish boy,
then hurried on to the others of the injured.
The lad had a pleasant, encouraging word for
each, making memoranda of things the wounded
men wished him to do for them. They knew
he would do what he promised, and it was a
source of great comfort to them to know that
the messages they wished conveyed to their
families would have the most careful attention
from the Iron Boy.</p>

<p>Some of the men were too badly hurt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
able to talk. These Steve did not try to question.
He did, however, question others, who had
been less severely injured.</p>

<p>The boy left the hospital with stern, set face.
He drew a long breath as he emerged into the
burning sunlight, shook himself and hurried to
the office. There he made a verbal report to
the head of the department, which very plainly
placed a good share of the blame on the foreman
of hearth number seven, Bill Foley.</p>

<p>While the head of the accident department
was closeted with the general superintendent
in an adjoining room, giving him the details of
the disaster, Steve was busily engaged in making
out his report, which he dictated to a stenographer.
Bob Jarvis stood on the other side
of the stenographer, his eyes fixed on Steve as
he made his report. Bob, listening intently, was
getting points for his own work.</p>

<p>Having completed his report, Rush got up,
stretched himself and looked at Bob.</p>

<p>"I'm through with this job," announced
Steve, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"Through with it? Why?"</p>

<p>"It's too slow for me."</p>

<p>"What's that you say, Rush?"</p>

<p>The Iron Boy turned and found himself looking
into the face of the general superintendent.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="center">MAKING A NEW START</p>


<p class="cap">"I BEG your pardon, Mr. Keating," apologized
Steve, reddening a little.</p>

<p>"So this work is too slow for you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that it has been rather the
opposite. You certainly have excitement enough,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Well, yes, sir, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Step into my office."</p>

<p>"Rush's going to get his," mumbled the telephone
operator, coming to life for the moment.
"I shouldn't care to be in his shoes just at present."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Rush. I will confess that I am
rather surprised at the remark that I just overheard
you make."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating was a man well past middle
age. His hair was gray, his bristling mustache
of the same shade, gray, twinkling eyes
adding greatly to the general effect of the face.
But it was the square-set jaw and the firm set
of the lips that revealed the iron in the make
up of the superintendent. All this Steve Rush
saw at a glance and understood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps I should not have been quite so
outspoken," admitted the lad. "That is a fault
of mine."</p>

<p>"That is not always a fault. Most honest
men are outspoken, my lad. But to return to
the subject of our discussion. I was in hopes
you would like the place we have given you. It
is an important position and difficult to fill. On
the other hand, you have shown remarkable
aptitude for the work. You have done better
in it than any other man we ever had."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"All the more reason why I wish you would
stay. You are not thinking of leaving the employ
of the company, are you?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Then what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is the matter, sir, except that I
don't particularly enjoy being the trouble man.
It is really my business to get others into
trouble, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all."</p>

<p>"It so turns out, just the same."</p>

<p>"I am sorry you look at it in that way."</p>

<p>"What is more, Mr. Keating, I wish to learn
the real business of iron and steel making."</p>

<p>"It strikes me that you have a pretty good
start already," said the general superintendent,
a grim smile appearing on his face.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall never learn it where I am. Of course
I have learned a great deal about first aid to
the injured and the like, also location of the different
departments in the mill. However, sir,
I want to learn the business, and I want to learn
by actual experience everything about the
mills."</p>

<p>"A very praiseworthy ambition. But we like
you very well where you are. As I have already
said, we have never had men in the accident
department who were as thorough and trustworthy
as you and Jarvis. It is also easy work,
compared with other occupations in the mill."</p>

<p>"That is just it, it's too easy. Give me something
hard, something that will keep my muscles
up. We have been leading an active life for the
past two or three years, Mr. Keating. We'll
go stale if we don't get to work soon."</p>

<p>"Will Jarvis wish to change also?"</p>

<p>"I have not talked the matter over with him.
He usually wants to go with me wherever I go."</p>

<p>"Have you any choice as to department or
work?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, save that I should like to work
through all of them."</p>

<p>"But, lad, there are many trades represented
in the mills. You cannot hope to learn all of
them," objected the general superintendent.</p>

<p>"I do not want to learn them all, Mr. Keating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
There is only one trade that I want to
learn, and I <i>do</i> want to know all about that,
even though it takes me years to learn it."</p>

<p>"What trade is that?" smiled the superintendent
indulgently.</p>

<p>"The steel trade. I want to learn the steel
business. I have a fairly good working knowledge
of the ore business right down to the gates
of the mills, but when I get inside the fence
surrounding the mills I am in an unknown
world, as it were."</p>

<p>"So it is to a majority of the men working
there. But I begin to understand. You have
ambitions," laughed Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, I have."</p>

<p>"What have you ambitions to become, if I
may ask?"</p>

<p>"To have as thorough a knowledge of the
manufacture of steel as any man in the country,"
answered Steve Rush boldly.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating gazed at the lad keenly. He saw
that the boy meant exactly what he said. The
superintendent saw the Iron Boy in a new light,
from a new viewpoint as it were. He had been
told by Mr. Carrhart, president of the mining
company, that these were two unusual boys,
and Mr. Keating had found them to be unusual
in that they were more efficient than any young
men he ever had had under him in the offices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
He had not, however, fully realized the extent
of the ambitions of the boys. Here was a boy
in a nice, easy berth, drawing twelve dollars a
week, and the boy was complaining because the
work was too easy. He wanted something to
do <i>to keep his muscles up</i>!</p>

<p>The superintendent's first inclination was to
laugh, but the sober, earnest face of the Iron
Boy robbed the situation of its humor.</p>

<p>"I have handled men for many years, my lad,
but I am forced to admit that I never had such
an unusual demand made upon me."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, if I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is usually quite the opposite. The young
fellows want something easier to do, and at
more pay. Let me see; you boys, I understand,
were drawing more than a hundred dollars a
month in the mines up on our iron ranges?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How much did you get on the lakes?"</p>

<p>"The same."</p>

<p>"And you are getting twelve dollars weekly
here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Quite a come down from twenty-five dollars
a week to twelve, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, as far as dollars and cents go. But
there are other things to consider when one
starts out to make a future for himself."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are right, my lad; there <i>are</i> other
things to consider. The trouble is that few of
our young men of the present generation consider
them. They expect to be pushed along
to the head of the procession, but without the
trouble of taking their turn in the ranks and
learning the business by the sweat of their
brows. I should like to be able to give you more
money; in fact, I have been considering giving
you an increase very soon. If you change, of
course, I shall not be able to do that. Wages
in the mills are fixed."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"A certain scale of prices prevails and it is
not within my power to change those prices.
Only the Board of Directors can do that by a
two-thirds vote."</p>

<p>"I shall be content with my present wages,"
answered Rush.</p>

<p>"That is just the trouble. You will not receive
your present wages. Your wages will, of
necessity, be reduced with your change of occupation."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well, sir."</p>

<p>"Yes! I am sorry, but the rule is inflexible."</p>

<p>"How much shall I get in the mills, sir?"</p>

<p>"We start all our boys and men at a dollar
a day."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you still of the opinion that you want
to make the change?" questioned the superintendent,
with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then all I have to say is that you are the
kind of young man that the steel company is
looking for," announced Mr. Keating, pushing
back the papers on his desk, toying thoughtfully
with a paper cutter.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Then you will give us a place
in the mills&mdash;you will permit us to make the
change without prejudice, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, yes."</p>

<p>"Where will you put us?"</p>

<p>"I shall have to think about that. I'll have
to pick out something hard," laughed the superintendent.
"I think we shall be able to satisfy
you on that point."</p>

<p>"I shall be satisfied, whatever you decide."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment. I will speak with the assistant
superintendent. Perhaps we can settle
the matter right here."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating stepped into an adjoining office
and was closeted with his assistant for some
time. What was said there, of course, Rush did
not know. When the superintendent returned
he was smiling.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, it's all settled," announced Mr.
Keating. "You will wish you hadn't spoken."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>The superintendent chuckled as if it were an
excellent joke. Steve smiled in sympathy with
the joke that he did not understand.</p>

<p>"You will receive the munificent sum of a
dollar a day, and your job will be in the cinder
pits."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; what do we do there?"</p>

<p>"Shovel cinders the greater part of the time.
You know the cinder pits are located in the
open-hearth furnace building. The cinders and
slag are dumped into these pits after the casts
are made. When the pits get cool enough the
pitmen get in and shovel the stuff out. Are
you fully decided to take the job?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"I see there is no swerving you from your
purpose. To tell the truth, I was in hopes you
would draw back. But, after all, I am glad that
you did not," added Mr. Keating, nodding his
head reflectively.</p>

<p>"When do we begin the new work, sir?"</p>

<p>"You may start in to-morrow morning. I
will have the foreman make a shift in order to
make room for you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir. What pit do we work in?"</p>

<p>"I will put you in number seven, Foley's
pit."</p>

<p>"I think I see my finish," muttered Steve.
He knew how Foley felt toward him for having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
made the report he did on the accident that day,
and Rush expected no quarter.</p>

<p>"I'll take what comes to me and keep my
mouth shut," he added to himself. But had the
Iron Boy known all that was in store for him
he might have changed his mind.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="center">IN THE CINDER PIT</p>


<p class="cap">BOB JARVIS had been a little doubtful
when Steve told him of the change in
their work. Bob thought the present
job was quite good enough, all but the pay; yet
he was willing to get along on twelve dollars a
week so long as he had so much leisure time.</p>

<p>On the following morning the two boys reported
for duty to the foreman of number
seven hearth, Bill Foley. There was a gleam
of quiet satisfaction in the eyes of the foreman
as he saw the boys coming toward his division.
He had been informed that they were to work
on a trick in number seven section. Foley did
not know why the change had been made. He
believed that, for some reason, the boys had
been reduced to the ranks. The only directions
he had received regarding what was to be done
with the Iron Boys was the injunction of the assistant
superintendent's messenger, to "make
them work till they can't tell a cinder pit from
a hole in the ground."</p>

<p>Foley grinned.</p>

<p>"You bet they'll work! Everybody in my
division works."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley's head pitman was a Pole named Watski
Kalinski, a heavy-faced man, surly and quarrelsome
at times, especially with the few men that
were under him. He understood cleaning the
cinder pits, however, and he was kept in his
place because of the work that his shift got
through with, rather than for any especial intelligence
that he might possess; which, as a
matter of fact, he did not.</p>

<p>Foley beckoned to him.</p>

<p>"Put those two boys in number seven pit."</p>

<p>"Easy or light?" grinned Watski.</p>

<p>"Easy or light, you mutton-head. That don't
mean anything. I know what you are getting
at, but I'll have you understand that these young
gentlemen are friends of mine. Give them the
best you have in the house."</p>

<p>The words had apparently been spoken in all
sincerity, but Watski grinned knowingly.</p>

<p>"I'll make the children happy, Mr. Foley.
Do they begin this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes; start them off now. I'll be around
later in the day to help carry out the remains."</p>

<p>Watski chuckled. He walked over to where
Bob and Steve stood waiting for orders to go
to work, surveying them from his beady, red
eyes; beady because nature had made them so,
red from the heat and the cinders of years in
the mills.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your name?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Rush."</p>

<p>Watski roared.</p>

<p>"That's the trick. Your name's Rush and
you'll be Rush, for you're going to rush if you
work in this section. What you been doing?"</p>

<p>"What we have been doing doesn't matter,
so far as you are concerned. It is what we are
going to do that concerns you. Will you please
put us to work, or have some one do so who
knows how?" asked Steve, perhaps with a
touch of maliciousness in his tone.</p>

<p>Kalinski bristled.</p>

<p>"Put you to work? Get somebody to put you
to work?"</p>

<p>"That is what I wish, sir."</p>

<p>"Shut up!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"What's the other kid's name?"</p>

<p>"My name is Bob Jarvis, and don't you take
any liberties with it, unless you've got an accident
insurance on your life."</p>

<p>Watski's face wrinkled angrily. He clenched
his fists, and for the moment it looked as though
he would fall upon Jarvis and punish him for
his boldness. Bob turned the tide by asking:</p>

<p>"When do we go to work? We're losing
time?"</p>

<p>"Yes; where do we work?" urged Steve.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>"See that cinder pit there?" leered the assistant.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Get in! Got your shovels?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Growling and making faces to himself the
Pole walked abruptly away, returning a few
minutes later with two shovels. He handed
them to the boys, giving the lads a shove toward
the cinder pit.</p>

<p>"Be good enough to keep your hands off me,
and at the same time kindly tell me exactly
what you wish me to do," demanded Steve.</p>

<p>"Wooden-heads! Fools! There is the
shovels and there is the cinders. Get them together;
shovel the cinders out; then if you don't
get enough work shovel them back again. Oh,
such&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on, Bob; Watski is getting excited.
He is likely to throw a fit and fall on a hot
plate, or something."</p>

<p>Steve walked over to the pit, surveying it
questioningly.</p>

<p>"That looks pretty hot to me, sir. Is it ready
to be thrown out?"</p>

<p>Bob was standing on the edge gazing at the
cinders. A faint cloud of steam was rising from
the pit, on which the hose had been played
gingerly for some time.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Watski gave him a push, Jarvis jumping to
save falling in on his face. The drop was not
more than two or three feet to the cinder bed,
which was some fifteen feet broad at its top,
tapering slightly toward the bottom.</p>

<p>Bob went in up to his knees. No sooner had
he done so than he uttered a wild yell.</p>

<p>"It's on fire! I'm burning up!" he howled.
"Help me out of this hole! Wow!"</p>

<p>Steve saw that Bob really was in distress.</p>

<p>"Jump out, if it's too hot."</p>

<p>"I can't. I'm stuck fast."</p>

<p>Watski was doubled up with laughter. He
howled with delight, sitting down on the cinders
with arms about his knees rocking back and
forth with shouts of merriment.</p>

<p>In the meantime Steve threw his shovel into
the pit, and crawling into the pit, used the
shovel for a support while he pulled his companion
out.</p>

<p>Bob's trousers were burned to the knees; his
underclothing was burned and the skin of his
shins was blistered from contact with the hot
cinders and slag.</p>

<p>Steve was so angry that he could scarcely
control himself, but he was determined to avoid
a fight if possible.</p>

<p>"Did he do that on purpose?" demanded
Jarvis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was in a hurry for us to get to work,
and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get busy there, you lazy louts or I'll dock
you for lost time!"</p>

<p>"You pushed me in!" shouted Bob. "You'd
better not dock me. I'll have something to say
about that."</p>

<p>"What is this disturbance about?" demanded
Foley, coming up at that moment. "Watski,
why aren't these men at work?"</p>

<p>"No good. Afraid of hot cinders."</p>

<p>"Does that look like being afraid?" interjected
Steve, pointing to his companion's burned
trousers. "I call that an outrage. However,
we'll not trouble about it this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You'd better not," growled Kalinski.</p>

<p>"This time," added Rush. "But I hope
nothing of the sort will happen again. We are
used to taking care of ourselves, and if we think
we are being imposed upon we are likely to
take matters into our own hands."</p>

<p>"Is that a threat&mdash;a threat directed at
Kalinski?" questioned Foley, ironically.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. We do not make threats; that is,
not until afterwards, perhaps," answered the
lad significantly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be a pretty good
idea for you men to get to work?" demanded
Foley. "You won't last long at this rate."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you can fix that pit so it will not burn
the skin from our legs we will go to work."</p>

<p>"That's up to you."</p>

<p>"Then I will see what I can do. I hope the
Honorable Mr. Watski Kalinski will keep away,
even if he is our boss."</p>

<p>"Yes, he'd better keep his distance from
me," growled Bob, who had been growing
angrier as he gazed at the grinning pit boss.</p>

<p>Rush, after a quick glance at both the foreman
and pit boss, began looking about for a
plank. He found a piece of the required length
after a time. This he threw into the pit, then
climbed down on it. His shovel threw out a
quantity of the hot cinders. Kalinski got them
full in the face. It had been purely an accident
on Steve's part, for the boss had changed his
position in order to look over into the pit to
see what his shoveler was doing.</p>

<p>The cinders burned Watski's face; they filled
his eyes and filtered down inside his shirt. The
boss danced a jig for the next minute or so,
slapping his chest, pulling his shirt as far from
him as he could and shrinking back to keep the
hot stuff from burning holes through his skin.</p>

<p>"Whoop!" howled Bob Jarvis. "Now, how
do you like it? Got a dose of your own hot
stuff that time, didn't you? Good for you,
Steve!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Rush's face reddened.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, but that was an accident.
I did not know you were there. I thought you
were sitting down over yonder."</p>

<p>Watski could not speak. His rage was consuming
him and the cinders were keeping his
hands fully occupied.</p>

<p>"I say, sir, it was an accident."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!" exploded the boss. "You&mdash;you
did it on purpose!"</p>

<p>With a growl of rage the Pole leaped into the
pit, intending to reach the plank. Steve hopped
out on the opposite side and Kalinski fell on
his face in the hot cinders.</p>

<p>Bob uttered a howl of delight. This was much
better than he had hoped for. Watski was getting
his punishment without the boys having to
administer it, and he was getting it properly,
judging from his yells.</p>

<p>By this time several men had gathered about
the pit, making no effort to hide their delight at
the Pole's predicament.</p>

<p>Rush hopped down to the plank, leaving his
shovel on the ground. He grabbed Kalinski by
the shirt collar and the seat of the trousers, and,
without any apparent effort, tossed the man
out of the pit. The spectators gazed at the
young man in amazement. His great strength
was a marvel to them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you let him toast some
more?" grumbled Bob. "He hasn't had enough
yet. I tell you, he's only half baked."</p>

<p>"Take your shovel and get in here. We shall
be in trouble the first thing we know," warned
Rush.</p>

<p>Bob obeyed reluctantly. He limped a little
as he walked toward the cinder pit, for his legs
pained him and there were blisters on his feet
where the hot cinders and slag had burned
through the shoes. Besides, he felt that he had
not done his duty.</p>

<p>"Did you hear Watski give you the lie,
Steve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I heard," answered Rush, beginning
to throw out cinders again. "He isn't worth
bothering with. Let him alone. We cannot afford
to have any fights at the beginning. I was
in hopes things would run along smoothly."</p>

<p>Foley leaned over the edge of the pit.</p>

<p>"I'll report you both; I'll have you fined!"
he growled.</p>

<p>"Go on!" jeered Rush. "Report the other
man. If you don't, I will."</p>

<p>"Let me at him! Let me at him!" yelled
Kalinski, starting for the pit. "I'll rub his
nose in the hot slag, I will! I'll show him he
can't throw hot cinders in my face. Git out of
my way!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="center">LAYING HANDS ON THE BOSS</p>


<p class="cap">IT was Foley's place to order the pit boss to
let the boys alone and attend to his own
business. Instead, Foley turned and
walked away. He did not go far, however. He
made his way to one of the open-hearth furnaces,
where, unobserved, he peered around the
corner of the red-hot pile of brick.</p>

<p>Rush saw that an encounter was unavoidable.
He was sorry, but he decided quickly to avoid
coming to blows if possible.</p>

<p>Kalinski had stooped over to pick up a shovel.
In his rage he was going to attack the boys with
it. Steve was out of the pit in a flash.</p>

<p>"Keep out of this, Bob, unless the others
mix in. I'll take care of that fellow."</p>

<p>When Watski straightened up he found the
Iron Boy standing over him with a pleasant
smile on his face.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't do that, were I in your place,
Kalinski. I tell you it was an accident, and I
am sorry I threw the cinders over you. I give
you my word that it was an accident."</p>

<p>Watski dropped his shovel, and uttering a
yell of rage, struck at Steve. The blow, had it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
reached its mark, would have knocked Rush
backward into the hot cinder pit. He dodged
the blow, however; then suddenly Watski
Kalinski found his wrists in a grip that made
him writhe. The Iron Boy's thumbs were pressing
on sensitive nerves.</p>

<p>"Ouch! Ouch!" howled the Pole.</p>

<p>Foley, in his wonder, forgot to hide himself.
He stepped from the protection of the furnace.</p>

<p>"Leggo my wrists! Leggo, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Will you behave yourself if I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll knock your head&mdash;ouch!"</p>

<p>The tears were actually running from the
eyes of the pit boss. He was suffering great
pain. But he got no sympathy from the mill
hands who had gathered about. They were
laughing and jeering at him, not especially because
they sided with Rush, whom they did not
know, but because Kalinski was not popular
among them.</p>

<p>At this juncture Bill Foley came running forward.
He saw that his pit boss was getting
the worst of it, and that Rush would soon gain
the sympathy of the crowd. He did not wish
this to happen. Had it been the other way
Foley would have been perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>The furnace foreman dashed around the pit,
headed for the humiliated boss. Jarvis saw him
coming. Bob stepped in front of Foley.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" demanded the
lad.</p>

<p>"Get out of my way before I hurt you!"</p>

<p>"And you keep out of this, or I'm likely to
forget myself and hurt you. You know it
wouldn't look well to have the foreman licked
by one of his men," grinned Jarvis.</p>

<p>Foley gazed at the Iron Boy in astonishment.
All at once he raised his foot, delivering a
vicious kick. The foreman never quite understood
how it happened, but the next second he
found himself falling backwards into the pit,
while the mill hands set up a roar.</p>

<p>Jarvis had been on his guard. When the kick
was delivered, he caught the ankle of the foreman,
giving it a quick jerk that threw the fellow
off his balance. There could be but one
result. Bill toppled over backwards, landing
on his head in the pit.</p>

<p>"Get him out of there! He'll burn to death,
Bob," warned Rush.</p>

<p>Bob helped the foreman out, but with reluctance.</p>

<p>"It would serve you right if you did burn.
But don't you try any of your funny business
on me again. You won't get off so easily if you
try it on another time."</p>

<p>"Kalinski, do you think you can let us alone
if I release you now?" questioned Steve.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The Pole did not answer, but if there ever
was murder in a man's eyes it was in Kalinski's.
Steve put on a little harder pressure.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; leggo! I don't want anything to
do with you. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Rush released the man instantly. At first the
Pole acted as though he was about to spring
upon his remarkable young antagonist. He
seemed to think better of it, however, after a
glance into the unsympathetic faces about him,
then into the smiling face of Steve Rush.</p>

<p>"Will you go to work, or must I throw you
out of the mill!" snarled Kalinski.</p>

<p>"We shall be glad to go to work if you will
let us alone. I wonder what the superintendent
would say if he happened along about this
time?"</p>

<p>"I shall fine both of you two days' pay," announced
Foley, making a memorandum in a
soot-soiled memorandum book.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. That is your privilege. It
is ours to protest, if we think best, which is not
saying that we shall. We have been used most
disgracefully, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't think of that when you got me
into trouble, did you?" sneered the foreman.</p>

<p>"So that is where the shoe pinches, is it? I
begin to understand. You propose to get even
with us? Well, all I have to say is that I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
advise you not to try it. We have come here
to work, and at our own request. If you become
unbearable I warn you we are perfectly
able to take care of ourselves, and we shall do
so. We don't propose to submit to any insults
from you or any one else, Bill Foley."</p>

<p>"Just put that in your pipe and smoke it!"
chuckled Bob.</p>

<p>Steve was at work again. Jarvis slowly followed
his companion to the pit, where both lads
stood on the plank and shoveled out cinders.
They gave no further heed to the foreman or
the pit boss. The latter two had drawn back
some little distance, where Kalinski was gesticulating
and talking to Foley with considerable
emphasis.</p>

<p>In a little while the shovelers had gotten down
to where the pit was aglow with coals. The
plank beneath their feet began to blaze up, the
smoke getting into their mouths and noses, setting
the lads to sneezing.</p>

<p>"I am going to get out of here," announced
Bob. "This is worse than the stoke-hole."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw, it isn't nearly so hot, though it
is about as dirty. I know, though, that the men
do not work in a pit as hot as this one is. There
must be some other way out of the woods. Yes;
we will climb up now. We shall be burned to
cinders soon if we don't."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that a joke?" demanded Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Is what a joke?"</p>

<p>"Burned to <i>cinders</i>."</p>

<p>"Certainly not," answered Steve, placing the
plank against the side of the pit. "Go on,
Bob."</p>

<p>The latter lost no time in crawling from the
hot hole. They were met by Kalinski at the
top.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it now?" he growled.</p>

<p>"Isn't there some way of cooling that pit off
a little? We can't work down there, or dig any
deeper, until it gets cooler. Why, it will burn
the clothes from our backs."</p>

<p>"Hope it does! Hope it burns you up,"
snarled the pit boss.</p>

<p>"I hope you haven't got your wishing cap
on," answered Jarvis, with a grin that was intended
to be humorous. "If you have, I'm
through."</p>

<p>"Can you not put some water on the cinders?
I see a hose right here," added Steve.</p>

<p>The boss saw that the boys were determined.
He knew that there would be no more work done
in the pit that morning, unless the pit was made
livable for the men. He could not afford to
have the work delayed, for that would reflect
on him.</p>

<p>Watski took up the hose sullenly, turned a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
tiny stream, and with a finger over the nozzle
gently sprayed the bed of hot coals. A cloud
of steam shot up into the air, whereat he shut
off the water instantly. Steve was watching
the process interestedly.</p>

<p>"I wonder why he doesn't turn the water in
full force?" mused the boy. He would not ask
questions of the surly Pole, preferring to pick
up what he could by observation. Bob had sat
down on the floor, where he examined his burned
clothes ruefully, at the same time gently rubbing
the blistered spots on his skin.</p>

<p>"I wish I dared throw that animal into the
pit head first," muttered Jarvis, eyeing the pit
boss resentfully. "I wonder why they have such
a beast at the head of anything."</p>

<p>The rumble of the charging machine, as it
thundered along the tracks on the other side
of the open-hearth furnaces with its load of
pig iron and scrap for the furnaces, attracted
Bob's attention for the moment. He was called
to attention by the voice of the boss.</p>

<p>"Rush, get in there. It's cool enough now.
Look here, you," he added, addressing Jarvis,
surveying the lad from head to feet as if trying
to decide upon the most vulnerable part of the
young man's anatomy for an attack.</p>

<p>"I'm looking. What's the answer?" retorted
Jarvis, gazing into the eyes of Kalinski.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"There ain't room for two such lummoxes
as you in that pit now. You take the next one
on number eight furnace."</p>

<p>"Is it as hot as this?"</p>

<p>"Hotter."</p>

<p>"Then I guess I will wait until it cools off,"
answered Bob, sitting down again.</p>

<p>Watski's face showed a dull red under the
cinder soot.</p>

<p>"You get up and go to work, unless you want
to lose your whole week's wages. What do you
think this is&mdash;a baby hospital?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know but it might be, seeing you
live here," retorted Jarvis, taking his time at
getting up, but keeping a weather eye on Kalinski,
who had a habit of suddenly forgetting himself,
as Jarvis already had discovered.</p>

<p>"Shall I cool the pit off?"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"With the hose."</p>

<p>The pit boss grinned.</p>

<p>"Think you can do it?"</p>

<p>"Of course I can do it. It doesn't take any
great amount of skill or intelligence to handle
an inch hose, does it?"</p>

<p>"Use it if you want to, but remember I
warned you."</p>

<p>"Against what?" demanded Bob, eyeing the
boss half suspiciously.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Against using the water."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!"</p>

<p>Jarvis went over to the tap, turning on a full
stream of water. When he straightened up
he saw that Kalinski was walking rapidly away,
so rapidly, in fact, as to be almost on a run.
Bob gazed after him inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I wonder what ails that Indian?" muttered
the lad. "He seems to be in a great hurry about
something."</p>

<p>Bob's attention was attracted to the water,
which was now spurting from the nozzle of the
hose, the stream shooting right over where
Steve was at work, sending a shower of fine
spray down on him.</p>

<p>"Hey, what are you doing up there?" he
shouted.</p>

<p>"Watering the plants," scoffed Jarvis.</p>

<p>"You just turn that hose the other way unless
you are looking for trouble. Why don't
you get to work?"</p>

<p>"Going to. I am at work already."</p>

<p>"Where is Kalinski?"</p>

<p>"He was sprinting down the shop the last I
saw of him. He seemed to be in a mighty big
hurry about something."</p>

<p>Bob dragged the hose over to the pit behind
open-hearth number eight. Then he began playing
the stream on the cinders full force. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
did not know that this was a very dangerous
proceeding. No one had told him, and the pit
boss had merely intimated it when he said, "Remember,
I warned you."</p>

<p>"This is fine," grinned the boy. "I could
do this all day and not get a stitch in my back.
Guess I will wet my legs."</p>

<p>He turned the hose on his blistered legs, the
water feeling cool and refreshing, for the lad's
burns were becoming more and more painful
as the dust from the mill settled into them.</p>

<p>Jarvis shifted the nozzle to the other side
and bathed the other leg, at the same time
keeping a watch for the boss. The latter was
nowhere in sight. He had gotten well out of
harm's way, evidently knowing what was about
to happen.</p>

<p>Having bathed himself to his satisfaction
Jarvis began playing the hose on the cinder pile.
The first contact of the water threw up a great
cloud of steam, followed by a sharp, hissing
sound. Steve knew by the sound that the other
pit was being wet down, but it did not occur
to him, either, that there was any danger in the
operation. In fact, he was too busy shoveling
the cinders from his own pit to give much attention
to what was going on in the other.</p>

<p>Bob was humming softly to himself as he
played with the stream, first sending it straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
up into the air so that the spray covered a wide
area by the time it reached the floor of the mill.
No one chanced to get wet, however, save the
two boys, Bob being the more so because he was
right under the shower. Next he turned the
stream straight into the pit, driving it down in
one place, trying to bore a hole in the cinders
and slag.</p>

<p>"Say, Steve!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"What do you think about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Puff!</p>

<p>A slender column of black smoke shot up
from the centre of the pit that Jarvis was watering
down. The lad stared at it in surprise.</p>

<p>"Look at the geyser!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>The ground under Bob Jarvis's feet rocked
liked a cradle. A great, black column rose from
under his very feet, lifting him from the floor
and hurling the boy straight up into the air.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="center">ON THE BRINK OF A VOLCANO</p>


<p class="cap">REVERBERATING crashes rent the air.
Workmen in that part of the mill were
hurled violently to the ground. Yells
and cries were heard on all sides. The interior
of the mill was full of flying debris.</p>

<p>Bob Jarvis had put too much water on the
pit. The sudden contraction, down deep among
the hot slag and cinders, had caused a tremendous
explosion, wreaking disaster for many feet
on either side of the pit. Kalinski, in all probability,
knew what would happen when he gave
Jarvis permission to soak down the cinders, and
no doubt that was why the boss made such haste
to get away from the spot. If he were not
there, he could not be held responsible for what
had occurred.</p>

<p>Fire spurted from the miniature volcano.
Crash after crash followed, as parts of furnaces
close by toppled over, though fortunately the
inside walls of the furnaces did not fall and
liberate their tons of molten metal. Many lives
would have been lost had that occurred. However,
the disaster was serious enough as it was,
and several men had been injured.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>The red light was displayed at the top of the
open-hearth building, but this time it was another
than Steve Rush who was hurrying to
the scene to gather the facts and give orders for
the care of the injured.</p>

<p>Steve was near the bottom of number seven
pit with cinders and slag raining down on him
in a perfect deluge. The lad instinctively
pulled his cap visor down over his eyes to keep
the stuff from getting into his eyes or burning
his face. He had no idea what had happened,
beyond the fact that there had been some sort
of explosion.</p>

<p>With quick presence of mind he grabbed up
the plank, standing it against the side of the
pit and began to climb. Quick as he was, he
was not quick enough to get clear of the shower.
It enveloped him; it choked and half smothered
him as he fought manfully to gain the top of
the pit.</p>

<p>"It's gripping me," thought the lad. "I'll
have a time getting out of this now."</p>

<p>The stuff was up to his knees, Rush meantime
kicking out vigorously, pulling himself up
inch by inch by sheer strength of arms and
hands. Had he not been such a muscular lad
he would have been at the bottom of the pit at
that moment, probably dead.</p>

<p>The cinders and slag gained the boy's waist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
He was nearing the top, but now he could make
little or no impression. He shouted for help,
but in the confusion none heard his call.</p>

<p>Steve kept struggling. He would never give
up as long as there was a single breath left in
him. Finally, however, he found that he was
making absolutely no progress. The grip of
the cinder and slag was getting tighter and
tighter as the stuff was packed about him.</p>

<p>Suddenly through the pall of smoke and dirt
a human face appeared, peering over into the
pit. There was a bandage about the head of
the man who was looking down into number
seven.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Rush?" called a familiar voice.</p>

<p>"Ye-yes," answered the lad, scarcely above
a whisper, for he was fast giving out. "Who&mdash;who
are you? Help&mdash;help me out. I'm fa-fast
and I&mdash;I'm burning u&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"This is Ignatz Brodsky. Sure, I help you.
Reach up your hands. You must make hurry.
We both get buried alive in the hot stuff."</p>

<p>Steve stretched up his arms to the boy Ignatz,
who had that morning come out of the hospital
and gone to work in the mill where he was employed
on a furnace a short distance down the
line from where the Iron Boys worked.</p>

<p>Ignatz knew whose pit had blown up. He
knew that Steve was in an adjoining one, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
from where he was shoveling he had seen
Rush go down into the cinder hole a little while
before the explosion occurred. As for Bob Jarvis,
he had not been seen since the black column
had lifted him from the floor.</p>

<p>Young Brodsky grasped the outstretched
hands and began tugging with all his might.
All his efforts were unavailing. Steve was
being buried deeper and deeper every second.</p>

<p>"Hang on&mdash;I get somebody!" exclaimed Ignatz,
darting away through the black cloud.</p>

<p>Kalinski, now running here and there, apparently
very much upset over the disaster, was
the first man the Pole met.</p>

<p>"Come quick!" he demanded, breathing hard.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" snarled Watski.</p>

<p>"The pit! There's a man in there and he
can't get out!"</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Rush. He die pretty soon if we no get him
out."</p>

<p>"Go on! Get him out yourself. I've got
plenty on my hands. I'll help you when I can
get to it. There are others here who need me.
Go along, now, and get the crazy fool out,"
added the pit boss, turning away.</p>

<p>Ignatz did not seem surprised. He appeared
more disappointed than otherwise. That one
of his countrymen should be so heartless made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
no great impression on the boy. What he was
concerned in now was finding some one who
would help him get his young friend out of the
pit.</p>

<p>Brodsky ran here and there, with the result
that he at last found two mill hands who hurried
to the pit with him. It was no easy task,
even for them, to get Steve out. The Iron Boy
was still conscious, but he was quite seriously
burned about the body. Fortunately he had
saved his head and face from being very badly
scarred.</p>

<p>After nearly pulling the boy's arms from his
shoulders, working him from side to side as
they would a post that they were trying to pull
out of the ground, the men dragged him to
safety.</p>

<p>"We take him to hospital," nodded Brodsky.</p>

<p>"Is the ambulance here?"</p>

<p>Ignatz nodded, whereupon the men carried
Steve out and placed him in an ambulance. A
second ambulance had just arrived, so the surgeon
of that made a quick emergency dressing
of the lad's burns, directing him to remain in
the ambulance. Rush felt no inclination to do
otherwise at that moment.</p>

<p>"Ignatz," he called.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want you to find Bob."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Mebby Bob is killed."</p>

<p>"Wait! Tell me what happened."</p>

<p>"The pit he blow up."</p>

<p>"What pit?"</p>

<p>"Number eight."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was the one Bob was sprinkling?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Put too much water on. Bang!" exclaimed
Ignatz, striking a dramatic attitude.</p>

<p>"Then he is surely killed or badly injured.
Run, Ignatz! Find him. Don't you come back
here until you have."</p>

<p>"Ignatz find him," answered the Pole, darting
back into the building, from which a dense
cloud of smoke was rolling through the crevices
in the roof and from the doors and windows.</p>

<p>No sooner had Brodsky left him than Steve
pulled himself up and peered out. There was
no one in sight, so he slipped from the ambulance.
He was barely able to stand alone, and
for a moment clung to a rear wheel of the wagon
for support.</p>

<p>The boy's burns hurt him so that he winced.
Every movement made him want to groan, but
he shut his lips tightly together and by sheer
force of will pulled himself up.</p>

<p>"I'm going in to look for Bob," he muttered,
starting unsteadily for the door of the mill.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>The smoke was still so thick that Rush could
not make out much of anything. He staggered
along until he reached the spot where the explosion
had occurred. There he found the accident
man gathering his facts.</p>

<p>"Hello, Rush! You're hurt, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Not much."</p>

<p>"Then you can tell me all about this. You
were in it, weren't you?"</p>

<p>"I guess I was. But I can't tell you anything
now. I'll tell you all I know later on. Have
you seen Jarvis?"</p>

<p>"No; where is he?"</p>

<p>"That is what I want to find out. He was
working on the pit that blew up."</p>

<p>"I guess he is settled then."</p>

<p>"I am afraid so."</p>

<p>"Well, we will hope not. I would help you
look for him, but you know I've got my hands
full," explained the man from the office.</p>

<p>"Yes; I understand. Hunt me up after you
get through, and I will give you all the information
I have, which isn't very much."</p>

<p>Rush started away. He came face to face
with the surgeon who had dressed his wounds.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here, Rush?" demanded
the surgeon. "You get back to the ambulance."</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Jarvis. You&mdash;you haven't
found him, have you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"No. Is he hurt?"</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>"That's too bad," muttered the ambulance
surgeon, returning to his work of dressing the
wounds of those who had been burned.</p>

<p>Rush went on, asking every one he met if they
had seen Jarvis. No one had. Foley, Kalinski,
all denied having seen the boy. Steve was perplexed.
By this time the smoke cloud began
to grow thinner and more transparent. One
could see fully half way across the shop. As
the cloud lifted, all became clear. The place
looked as if it had been in the grip of a cyclone,
though the damage was not nearly as great as
had at first appeared.</p>

<p>"Who is killed?" asked Rush.</p>

<p>"No one, so far as I know," answered the
man addressed.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Bob Jarvis anywhere
about?"</p>

<p>"Don't know him. Who is he?"</p>

<p>"He was my partner. He was working on
number eight when it blew up."</p>

<p>"Then you'll need a basket to gather him
up," was the cheerful answer of the mill hand.
"The last time a pit exploded here we lost
twelve men. We found the pieces of them, but
somehow we never were able to put them together.
The pieces wouldn't fit, nohow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve turned away. The lad's face was
drawn and white, partly from the pain of his
burns and partly from anxiety for Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Ignatz!" he called, observing the Pole darting
across to the furnaces.</p>

<p>The lad halted sharply and glanced around to
see who was calling him. He caught Steve's
eye and hurried over.</p>

<p>"Have you found Jarvis?"</p>

<p>Brodsky shook his head.</p>

<p>"Mister Bob not here," he said.</p>

<p>"He must be," protested Steve.</p>

<p>"Mebby Bob him run away," suggested the
Pole.</p>

<p>"No, Ignatz; he is not that kind. He is here
somewhere and something has happened to him
or we should have seen him somewhere about.
He was standing on the edge of the pit at the
time it exploded."</p>

<p>"I see him a minute before. He put too much
water on," added the boy, with a shake of the
head. "Bad, bad! Somebody tell him do
that."</p>

<p>Rush attached no especial significance to the
suggestion at the moment. Later on, the words
of the faithful Pole came back to him fraught
with meaning.</p>

<p>"He must have been thrown up into the air.
Perhaps he is down in the pit there buried under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the slag now," said Rush, a sudden, startled
expression flashing into his eyes.</p>

<p>Brodsky instinctively glanced upwards.</p>

<p>"Look! Look!" cried the Pole, dancing up
and down and pointing excitedly up above their
heads into the thin cloud of smoke that hovered
over them.</p>

<p>Steve looked. His heart sank within him as
he did so and his head began to whirl dizzily.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="center">BOB'S DIZZY FLIGHT</p>


<p class="cap">"BOB, him there! Bob, him there!" cried
Ignatz. "See, see!"</p>

<p>On a girder, a huge steel truss some
fifteen feet above their heads, and a little to one
side of the centre, lay a limp figure, apparently
ready to topple off at the slightest jar. The
face of the figure up there was not visible, for
it was flattened on the girder, while the arms
and limbs hung over limp and motionless.</p>

<p>"It's Bob!" gasped the Iron Boy. "Help
me, Ignatz! We must get him down."</p>

<p>Young Brodsky did not wait to consider the
matter. He darted away, followed by Steve.
To reach the figure on the girder the lads were
obliged to climb the upright of a big automatic
crane that was used for conveying heavy pieces
of iron from one end of the building to the other.
Ordinarily the boys would have been stopped,
but in the excitement no one paid any heed to
them as they shinned up the iron column, Steve
in the lead, Brodsky so close behind him that
now and then Rush's heels grazed the Pole's
face.</p>

<p>Steve crept along the girder, using care not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to cause it to vibrate any, lest he might be the
means of shaking his companion down.</p>

<p>At last he reached the spot where Jarvis lay.</p>

<p>Steve uttered a shout to attract the attention
of those below. As they glanced up they comprehended
at once. Jarvis had been blown to
the girder by the pit explosion. From appearances
the spectators believed him to be dead.
Steve did not know whether such were the case
or not. He realized the necessity for haste if it
were not.</p>

<p>"Throw me a rope," shouted the lad.</p>

<p>"There ain't any ropes here. Throw him
over," called a voice jeeringly. The boys on
the girder recognized it as belonging to Kalinski.</p>

<p>"Somebody get a rope, I tell you!" thundered
Rush.</p>

<p>One was brought, coiled and tossed up. The
first time it went wide of the mark and Steve,
holding to Bob's unconscious form, fuming with
impatience, nearly lost his balance in trying to
catch the rope. The next time he was more successful.</p>

<p>"Grab hold of the end, two or three of you
down there," commanded the lad, letting an end
of the rope drop to the ground. In the meantime
he had made the other end fast around the
waist of Bob Jarvis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you all ready down there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; let him come."</p>

<p>After a keen glance below, to make sure that
the men would not let the boy drop, Steve gently
pushed Bob over the edge of the beam. Jarvis's
body spun around like a top several times
as it was being lowered. Rush breathed a sigh
of relief when he saw it safely deposited.</p>

<p>"Hold fast to the end of the rope. We're
coming down," Rush shouted. Swinging himself
over, he slid down, followed by Ignatz. The
surgeon was already at work over Bob.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The boy is alive," answered the surgeon.
"I don't know how long he will be. We must
get him to the hospital at once. Here, carry
this boy out!" he commanded. "Have the
driver hurry in with him. I will go on the other
wagon, as soon as I have dressed the wounds of
this other man."</p>

<p>Steve started to follow the men who were
carrying Bob out.</p>

<p>Kalinski grabbed Steve by the arm.</p>

<p>"See here, where you going?"</p>

<p>"To the hospital with my friend."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the sort. You're going to get
to work, that's what you are going to do. You'll
have lots of time to visit the hospital when you
take your vacation."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve Rush hesitated. He wanted to be with
Bob, but he knew he had no right to walk out
and leave his work in this manner. It would
be sufficient cause for his discharge were he to
do so.</p>

<p>"Then I will ask you to let me off for the
rest of the day."</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you to go to work?" shouted
Kalinski. "I'll have you fired for this day's
work if it's the last thing I ever do."</p>

<p>Rush did not understand the full meaning of
the words. He was troubled. Things were not
going with the same smoothness that they had
for the last two years. Steve was in an atmosphere
different from that of the mines, or even
of the lakes. He did not know just how to adjust
himself to the conditions. Then, again,
there was Bob in the hospital, perhaps dying.</p>

<p>"I must do my duty, and I'm going to do it,"
muttered the Iron Boy. "They shan't say that
I am not to be depended upon. What do you
want me to do, Mr. Kalinski?" he asked, turning
to the pit boss.</p>

<p>"Now, what do you suppose I want you to
do? What were you doing before you two blew
up the mill?"</p>

<p>"In the first place we did not blow up the mill.
I was working in pit seven when the other one
exploded."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then git back in number seven, unless you
want me to throw you in&mdash;or out of the mill altogether.
I'll have you fired if the boss don't
do it for me."</p>

<p>"I don't think you will fire me," answered
Steve, bristling.</p>

<p>"I won't, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, you won't!"</p>

<p>"I'll either fire you out of the shop or else
I'll break your head for you. Take your
choice."</p>

<p>Steve surveyed the irate boss for a few seconds,
then picking up his shovel walked slowly
toward the pit in which he had had such a narrow
escape from death.</p>

<p>Watski grinned sardonically.</p>

<p>"That's the time I took the wind out of his
sails. I'll comb him down so fine he'll be sorry
he ever got in my shift. It ought to be easy
now. I've got both of them dead to rights. You
bet I have!"</p>

<p>Rush was throwing out the cinders, raising
a fine black dust that sifted over him like mist,
except that in this case the mist was black. He
toiled on steadily, scarcely taking a second for
rest. The perspiration was rolling from his
face and body. The temperature was high out
doors and many degrees higher in the mill.
Just back of Steve, so close that he could hurl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
a shovel of cinders against it, was a huge open-hearth
furnace with a roaring temperature of
three thousand degrees Fahrenheit inside of it.
Beneath him was the hot bed of cinders and
slag. Beyond him was a long row of red hot
ingots, running metal and hot steam pipes.</p>

<p>"It isn't any wonder that I feel a little
warm," smiled the boy, wiping the perspiration
from his brow, at the same time taking quick
note of his surroundings.</p>

<p>Traces of the accident were being rapidly removed.
In a few moments no evidences of it
would be left. The blown-up pit had been partially
filled with slag that fell back after the explosion,
and already a shoveler was at work
throwing the stuff out. The pit must be made
ready for the next cast, and the furnace was
nearly ready for the cast.</p>

<p>Rush toiled until noon. He sat down to his
lunch which he had brought with him, without
opportunity to wash. The noon rest was to be
for only twenty minutes, so there was no time
to waste.</p>

<p>After finishing he walked to the door and
gazed off toward the hospital, wondering how
Bob was. Rush could see the roof of the hospital
from the doorway, but that was scant comfort.
He turned back, walking slowly toward
his pit to take up the dreary afternoon's shoveling.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Just as he reached the pit a light touch
on his shoulder caused him to wheel sharply.</p>

<p>There was the boy, Brodsky. He was breathing
hard.</p>

<p>"Hello, Ignatz, you're all out of breath," exclaimed
Steve.</p>

<p>"I been by the hospital."</p>

<p>"You have? Tell me, quickly, how is Bob?"
demanded Rush, gripping the arm of the Polish
boy.</p>

<p>"Him wake up."</p>

<p>"He is conscious, then? Good, good! Tell
me how he is?"</p>

<p>"Him not dead. Him get well, by and by."</p>

<p>Steve's face lighted up happily.</p>

<p>"Ignatz, you are a good boy. Did you go
without your lunch for the sake of going over
to see how my friend is?"</p>

<p>Ignatz nodded, pleased at the pleasure of his
friend.</p>

<p>"Doctor say Bob pretty much hard hit, but
him get well."</p>

<p>"Go get your lunch, quick, before the whistle
blows," ordered Steve.</p>

<p>Ere the words were fairly out of his mouth
the shrill blast of the shop whistle sent all hands
scurrying for their stations, Brodsky among the
number.</p>

<p>"Look out! Trouble him come quick!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
warned the Pole, whispering in Steve's ear just
before he bounded away.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he meant by that?" muttered
Rush. "We surely have had trouble enough.
I guess I'm a failure as a steel worker. But
no! I'll beat it yet. I'll win out! They can't
down me. I'll go through with it, and some of
these fellows shall yet be taking orders from
Steve Rush!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="center">AN UNJUST SENTENCE</p>


<p class="cap">"YOU are wanted in the superintendent's
office!"</p>

<p>Steve looked up from the pit into the
face of a messenger.</p>

<p>"Superintendent Keating, you mean?"</p>

<p>"No, Mr. McNaughton, superintendent of the
open-hearth furnaces. He's the boss of this department,"
grinned the messenger.</p>

<p>"Will I have time to wash?"</p>

<p>"You'd better be coming along, if you know
what's good for you."</p>

<p>"Very well, but I must first report to the pit
boss."</p>

<p>"He isn't here. He knows where you are
going."</p>

<p>"All right, I'll take your word for it. What
does Mr. McNaughton want with me?"</p>

<p>"He'll tell you when you see him," answered
the boy.</p>

<p>Steve thought that the summons had something
to do with the explosion in the pit. He
had no idea that he was to be involved in any
way, so he walked confidently along with the
messenger, out at the rear door and on to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
low, rambling building just across the tracks
from the open-hearth building. This was the
office of Superintendent McNaughton. Steve
did not remember to have seen this superintendent
before. The messenger, after entering
with Rush, opened a door leading into a large
office, and shoved Steve in.</p>

<p>A sandy-haired, rugged-faced man sat at a
desk, while around the room were several men
from the shops. Among them were Bill Foley
and Watski Kalinski. The latter grinned when
he saw Steve.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" demanded the man at
the desk gruffly.</p>

<p>"Stephen Rush."</p>

<p>Steve's face was so coated with grime that it
was unrecognizable, even to one who knew him
well, which the superintendent did not.</p>

<p>"A man named Jarvis is your side partner,
isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He is in the hospital now."</p>

<p>"Never mind about volunteering information,
my man. I'll ask whatever questions I
want answered."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Where were you when the explosion in number
eight occurred?"</p>

<p>"I was shoveling in number seven."</p>

<p>"Did you see the explosion?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at first. I saw the latter part of it."</p>

<p>"What was the man Jarvis doing the last
time you saw him?"</p>

<p>"Sprinkling the cinders in number eight."</p>

<p>"Humph! What did you tell the fool to do
that for?"</p>

<p>"I tell him?" questioned Steve wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I did nothing of the sort."</p>

<p>"Didn't the pit boss warn both of you not
to put water on the pit when it was hot?"</p>

<p>"He did not. I heard him utter some sort of
a warning, but it was not definite enough for
me to understand what he was getting at."</p>

<p>"Kalinski, what did you tell me about this
man's having told his partner to hose down the
pit?"</p>

<p>Watski rose, full of importance.</p>

<p>"One of the men told me he heard this fellow
Rush tell the other man to turn the hose on
and cool the blamed pile off quick."</p>

<p>"He <i>lies</i>!"</p>

<p>Steve uttered the words quietly but incisively.</p>

<p>"Silence!" thundered Mr. McNaughton. "I'll
have you turned over to the Iron and Steel
Police if I hear any more of your impudence."</p>

<p>"I had no intention of being impudent to you.
I simply said the man lies, and I repeat it. He
knows no such order was ever given by me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
he knows that no one told him any such thing,"
added Rush boldly.</p>

<p>Kalinski's face was a study. It turned from
red to white in rapid succession. The boss's
fists were tightly clenched and he seemed to be
trying to regain his voice, which had suddenly
deserted him.</p>

<p>"Sit down!" commanded the superintendent,
projecting a finger at Kalinski. "Rush, you be
careful that you do not go too far. I am not
inclined to stand much of your impudence."</p>

<p>"Mr. McNaughton, am I to be accused of
something I did not do, and then not be allowed
to say anything in my defense?" demanded the
boy.</p>

<p>"I will be the judge of what you did and did
not do. Foley, you say several of the men saw
these two talking together&mdash;Rush and Jarvis,
just prior to the explosion."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And that the man Jarvis then went back to
number eight and began playing the hose on it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you deny this, Rush?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I don't remember whether
we were in conversation just before the accident
or not. I can't remember. I do not think we
were, however."</p>

<p>"You will admit the accusation in a moment,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
snapped the superintendent. "You had been
told that it was dangerous to put water on a
hot pit&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had not, sir, neither did I put water on a
hot pit. I knew Jarvis was sprinkling number
eight, but I did not know that such a thing was
dangerous. How should I? It was my first day
in the mills. I was just beginning my work
there. But, sir, what is it you are trying to do
with me? Are these two men trying to get me
into trouble?"</p>

<p>"It begins to look as if you had gotten yourself
in, without any of their assistance. Does
any one know how badly the man Jarvis has
been injured?"</p>

<p>"I understand it is not serious," answered
Steve.</p>

<p>"I shall have to discipline you both," began
the superintendent.</p>

<p>"There can be no doubt," spoke up Foley,
"that they were both to blame. It looked almost
as though they did it maliciously, but that
is hardly possible, as they were taking long
chances. It was disobedience of orders, as
plain as the nose on your face."</p>

<p>Kalinski nodded emphatically.</p>

<p>"I agree with you. Rush, what do you think
we ought to do in a case like this?"</p>

<p>"Am I to speak as I think?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"You won't like what I am going to say."</p>

<p>"Then I will stop you if you say anything
you ought not to."</p>

<p>"What I not only think but know ought to
be done, is to kick the man Kalinski and the
man Foley out of the place. I shouldn't ask
them to go, I'd use my boot. Both men have
lied. The truth is not in them, and some day
you will find it out, even if you don't know it
now."</p>

<p>The two bosses sprang to their feet, starting
toward Steve, who stood eyeing them calmly,
but in a belligerent attitude.</p>

<p>"I'd like nothing better than putting it over
you two loafers. But, of course, you haven't
the nerve to stand up one at a time and resent
the imputation that you are liars."</p>

<p>"Stop!" thundered Mr. McNaughton.</p>

<p>"You told me to speak plainly. I am doing
so, but I am telling the truth. Foley is angry
with me because I told the truth and got him
into trouble when I was in the accident department.
He tried to get me to lie for him then.
I knew, then, that he was more crooked than
a steel rail coming through the rolls, and that's
all I've got to say. I am glad to have put myself
on record, and I'll take my medicine like
a man, though the day will come when you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
find that these men are rascals. The sooner
you get rid of them the more certain will you
be to avoid trouble. Good day&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on, sir! Not quite so fast!" commanded
the superintendent of the open-hearth
building. "I have something to say for myself.
The evidence is against you two. You have
convicted yourselves. I have perfect confidence
in both Foley and Kalinski. They have been
faithful employs for many years."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"It is natural that I should take their version
in preference to that of a man of whom I know
nothing, and who has been in the mills less than
a day."</p>

<p>"Even if those men are rascals," interjected
Rush. "I dislike to use the word, but it is the
only word I know that fits the case. If you wish
to know anything about the honesty of myself
and my companion, I wish you would be good
enough to speak to Superintendent Keating.
He knows people who have known us for some
time, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I am running this division, young man. I
think I am able to judge between right and
wrong."</p>

<p>"Very well; I have nothing further to say
in my defense. What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"I am going to do the only thing that can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
done under the circumstances, though I dislike
to do it with one of you in the hospital&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Please do not let that interfere with your
decision," urged Steve.</p>

<p>"I shall not. You are both discharged!"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You're discharged! Leave the mills at once,
handing in your time at the gate as you go out.
I will advise the paymaster to hand you your
money to-day, so you will not have to hang
around until pay-day."</p>

<p>"Thank you. You are very considerate, indeed,"
answered the Iron Boy, sarcastically.
"I bid you good afternoon. I hope some day
you will discover that you did two boys a very
great injustice. As for you," announced Steve
in a firm tone, stepping over to where the two
bosses sat grinning, "if you will come outside
with me it will give me great pleasure to punch
both your heads. But you don't dare! You'd
call the police and have me arrested before I
had gone one round with you. Good afternoon,
Mr. McNaughton."</p>

<p>Steve strode from the office with head up. A
dull flush showed under the soot on his face.
He had met with his first real rebuff. He did
not mind that so much as he did the fact that
he had suffered through the untruthfulness of
others. Rush knew that neither he nor his companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[</a></span>
were in any way to blame for what bad
happened. Neither of them knew that it was
dangerous to sprinkle a cinder pit. Foley and
Kalinski did know it and they had deliberately
turned away when they saw Jarvis getting ready
to wet down number eight.</p>

<p>"I'll not give up!" muttered Steve as he
walked swiftly from the yards. As he passed
the gate the gateman called to him to leave his
number.</p>

<p>"I have no number," answered the lad. "I
don't work here any more."</p>

<p>"You won't get your money if you don't hand
in your time."</p>

<p>"I don't want any money that I haven't
earned. I tell you I am not working here."</p>

<p>"I guess the boy must have been fired,"
grinned the gatekeeper, who knew that Steve
had been working in the mills up to that time.</p>

<p>In the meantime Steve Rush was hurrying
toward the hospital to see how Bob Jarvis was
getting along.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="center">IGNATZ ON THE WAR PATH</p>


<p class="cap">STEVE found his companion sitting up in
a chair, with head and hands bandaged.
Bob had been quite severely burned, and
he had suffered from the shock of the explosion.
The surgeon said it was a miracle that he had
not been killed instantly.</p>

<p>"Hello, Steve," greeted Bob. "I can't grin
without hurting myself, but I'm grinning on the
inside of me."</p>

<p>"Oh, Bob, I'm so glad you are safe! I thought
you had been killed when I found you were missing.
What happened to you? Tell me all about
it. I haven't heard the truth about it yet."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to tell, except that I was
a bird. I flew without wings, and that is more
than any one else can do. Did you see me go?"</p>

<p>"No, I did not, but some other persons did."</p>

<p>"Eh, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Foley and Kalinski."</p>

<p>Jarvis looked thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Say, that's what that fellow meant when
he warned me. Why didn't he say what he was
warning me about? Look here, he knew I was
going to get into trouble, didn't he?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have more than a suspicion that he did,"
nodded Rush.</p>

<p>"Wait till I get out of this harness," growled
Bob. "What happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much. I was nearly buried under
the cinders, but Brodsky ran for some men, who
dug me out. If it hadn't been for Ignatz I believe
I should have perished in number seven
pit."</p>

<p>"He's a good fellow!" muttered Bob, nodding
his head faintly. "He doesn't know much,
and he wouldn't take a blue ribbon at a beauty
show, but he's got the real stuff in him. I hear
one man is going to die."</p>

<p>"Yes; so I understand. Too bad, poor fellow."</p>

<p>"And <i>I</i> did it!"</p>

<p>"Don't blame yourself. You were not to
blame for what happened. You were led directly
into the mistake of putting too much
water on the cinders. When is the doctor going
to let you go home?"</p>

<p>"He said perhaps I could go in the morning,
but I'm all right. I could go home now, just as
well as not. I want to go back to the mill and
go to work in the morning."</p>

<p>"No need of that. I don't think either of us
will start in to-morrow."</p>

<p>"What? Not start in? What do you mean?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind now. We will talk about it
when you get home."</p>

<p>"Look here, Steve Rush, something has been
going on that I don't know anything about.
What is it?"</p>

<p>"Don't bother about asking questions. I
shouldn't have excited your curiosity," answered
Steve, laughing to cover his chagrin at
having let the words slip out. "I'll tell you what
we'll do; we will take our lunches and go down
the river to-morrow for a picnic, if you are able.
After you have rested up for a day perhaps
you will feel able to go to work."</p>

<p>"But you said we weren't going to work."</p>

<p>"Did I?"</p>

<p>"You did, and I want to know why. Come
on now; I'm no tenderfoot, and you know it.
Why don't we go to work?"</p>

<p>"Because we have both been discharged.
There, you have it, now."</p>

<p>"Fired?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"You ought to be able to guess."</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a guesser."</p>

<p>"Well, then, because we blew up the pit."</p>

<p>Bob gazed at his companion unbelievingly.</p>

<p>"Come now, you're joking. They're not all
fools down at the mill. I blew up the pit&mdash;you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
didn't, and I didn't know that I was doing so,
of course. I'm no anarchist, and neither are
you."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, they hold us responsible for
it."</p>

<p>"I know who's at the bottom of this. It's
that wooden Indian, Kalinski, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Foley," added Steve.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're a choice pair. They have had
a rod in pickle for both of us ever since you
made the report on Foley at the time of that
burning accident. Did <i>they</i> fire us?"</p>

<p>"No, not directly. Mr. McNaughton did so,
but they were at the bottom of it. They told
him lies about us, and he believed them. Think
of it, Bob. He wouldn't believe what I told
him. He thought I was the one who was telling
the untruths."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it."</p>

<p>Rush did so, relating all that had occurred
during his visit to the division superintendent's
office, the injured boy listening with darkening
face as the narration continued. He nodded
approvingly when Steve related how he had invited
the two men out to get their heads punched.</p>

<p>"Didn't go, did they?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I thought not. They've both got a streak
of yellow in them that runs all the way from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
their heads down into their boot-tops. Wait
till I get out! I've got a couple of good, swift
punches in stock for them! They won't wake
up for half an hour, once I unlimber," threatened
Jarvis, shaking his bandaged fists threateningly.</p>

<p>"Bob, promise me one thing. Promise me
that you will not have any trouble with those
men. We can't afford to mix up in any disgraceful
fights here. They would like nothing
better than to have us do so. We should be
arrested. Think of the disgrace of it! We will
let them alone as long as they let us alone. We
won't stir up any more trouble, but they must
let us alone. Will you promise to be guided by
me in this matter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. I am afraid I shall lose my
temper when I see them; then, if they say anything
to me, it's all off. What are we going
to do, now that we are out of a job?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Steve thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what let's do. Let's go back
to the mines. We have fine jobs with good pay
waiting for us there. We never should have
left. Mr. Carrhart will be glad to have us."</p>

<p>Rush shook his head.</p>

<p>"We came down here to learn the iron and
steel business, and we are going to do exactly
that one thing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you tell me how?"</p>

<p>"There are other mills. We will try to get
in one of them. I am going to start out to-morrow
to look for work."</p>

<p>"I thought we were going on a picnic to-morrow,"
grinned Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so. Well, then, the day after
to-morrow will be time enough for us to look
for another place. Fortunately we are not
broke. We have enough money in the bank to
keep us for a long time, but that isn't the question.
The question is whether or not we are
going to get a job."</p>

<p>"I hope we don't. I'd much rather be underground,
digging ore or bouncing about on the
Great Lakes."</p>

<p>"You did not like the Lakes any better, when
you first went out on them. Let's not confess
that we are weak-kneed."</p>

<p>"No; but I've got a burned knee and it
smarts," retorted Bob.</p>

<p>"So have I," laughed Steve. "I am behind
you, though. You aviated yourself up to the
roof, while I got buried in the pit. That was
the time both ends did not meet. Well, I'm
going home to clean up and dress. I will come
back later, and, if the doctors will permit you
to leave the hospital to-night, I will take you
with me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go, whether they let me, or not," said
Bob. "What's the use in hanging around here?
If I'd broken my stanchions, or smashed in
some of my plates, then things would be different.
But I am all right. Never felt better in
my life, except for the burns."</p>

<p>Bidding his companion good-bye, Steve left
the hospital and went home. His face was serious
and thoughtful. On the way he stopped at
the Brodskys, leaving word that he would like
to have Ignatz come and see him that evening.</p>

<p>"Discharged!" muttered the Iron Boy.
"Well, who would have thought it? I might go
and see Mr. Keating&mdash;but no, I'll not play the
baby act and squeal. I'll show McNaughton
and his bosses that I don't ask any odds of their
old mills. Yet I <i>did</i> want to stay with the company.
Well, we shall see what luck I have when
I get ready to look around a bit."</p>

<p>Later in the day Rush returned to the hospital.
Jarvis was permitted to go with Steve,
with the understanding that the injured boy
return on the following morning to have his
burns dressed. Then the two went home. Jarvis
was weak and staggered a little, but he
would not let Rush take his arm. He laughed
at the suggestion. When they got home they
found Ignatz at their boarding house. The Polish
boy was delighted to see them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bob, if it hadn't been for Ignatz, we should
have been in a worse mess than we are. He's
one of the white men in this smoky part of the
country."</p>

<p>"I'll shake with you when my hands get
well," laughed Jarvis. "I can't even shake my
head now. I couldn't shake if I had an attack
of chills."</p>

<p>"I suppose you know that we have lost our
positions, don't you, Ignatz?" asked Steve.</p>

<p>Brodsky nodded moodily.</p>

<p>"I hear men say you no work in open-hearth
place any more."</p>

<p>"Well, it does look as if we shouldn't."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you all about it." Rush told the story
fully, and without reserve, to their faithful
friend, Brodsky listening attentively with emotionless
face.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he grunted after the recital had come
to an end. "Watski say you blow up pit?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Huh! Watski much liar! Foley, him liar,
too. All liars. You see superintendent?"</p>

<p>"We saw Superintendent McNaughton. It
was he who sent for us and discharged us."</p>

<p>"No, I mean Superintendent Keating?"</p>

<p>"No, Ignatz; we can't go to him with our
troubles. That would be too much like whining,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
and we are not the kind of boys who go
about crying because we have been whipped."</p>

<p>"You lick Kalinski?"</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, nothing would give me
greater pleasure. But we are not going to do
anything of the sort&mdash;that is, if he keeps away
and lets us alone."</p>

<p>"I'd like to catch him on the hot metal bridge
some fine night when there wasn't anybody
near," growled Bob, shaking his padded fist.</p>

<p>"What I sent for you for, Ignatz, was to ask
you about some of the other mills. I have not
been here long enough to know about them.
Will you tell me what the other mills are, and
whom to see? I am going to try to get a job."</p>

<p>Brodsky named the independent mills. There
were ten of them in all. He knew the names of
some of the foremen, and said he would get the
names that he did not know.</p>

<p>"You want me more?" demanded the Pole,
rising abruptly.</p>

<p>"No, but we should like to have you spend
the evening with us, if you have no other place
to go," said Steve.</p>

<p>Brodsky shook his head.</p>

<p>"Must go home split the wood for my mother.
She take a club to me if I don't. I see you
bimeby, mebby to-night, mebby the day after
to-morrow."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy turned and left the room at a trot.
Bob laughed heartily after he had gone.</p>

<p>"There's an odd lad," he said.</p>

<p>"He's true-blue, Bob. Under all his stolidness
he is every inch a man, as I have said
many times before. He is more cut up over
our hard luck than we are. I hope he doesn't
try to induce Kalinski to take us back. That
would please the pit boss, because he would
think we had asked Ignatz to intercede for us.
I would rather never have a job again than to
ask either of those three men to take us back."</p>

<p>"I wonder what the general superintendent
will say when he hears about it?" asked Jarvis.</p>

<p>"He will not be likely to hear of it at all,
unless some time he happens to think about us
and asks. Even then he will be given the same
story that Foley and Kalinski told Mr. McNaughton.
I hope he doesn't hear it, for then
our friends at the mines will learn the same
story, and we shall be disgraced in their eyes."</p>

<p>"No, we won't! I'll see to it that we are not."</p>

<p>"I think we had better postpone our picnic
to-morrow, seeing that you have to go to the
hospital to have your burns dressed. That will
give me an opportunity to visit some of the
other mills, and I'll wager I'll come back with
a job for both of us in my pocket to-morrow
night."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right; I don't care. I'm getting so that
everything goes and nothing matters at all. I'm
getting to be an old man&mdash;a feeble old man,
Steve Rush," said Bob, in all seriousness.</p>

<p>Rush laughed heartily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the meantime Ignatz Brodsky had left the
house. Strangely enough he appeared to have
forgotten his promise to go home and split wood
for his mother, the widow Brodsky. Instead,
he started in the opposite direction. Ignatz was
nodding to mill men whom he knew, now and
then halting to speak to one, asking a question
of another, but keeping on his way.</p>

<p>All at once his stolid face melted into a smile
so soft and pleasing that no one would have
thought him incapable of feeling. The object
that had brought the smile to the face of the
Polish boy, however, was none other than Watski
Kalinski swinging down the street. Ignatz
pretended not to see the pit boss. As they were
passing Brodsky lurched against the boss.</p>

<p>"What for you bump me?" demanded the lad,
in an angry tone.</p>

<p>"Git out of the way before I hit you!"
growled Kalinski.</p>

<p>"What for you run against me?"</p>

<p>"I didn't. You run into me. You're a
<i>li</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Whack! <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Ignatz was a stocky boy, even though he was
only seventeen years old. He had been used to
heavy work all his life; in fact, he had had little
schooling, having had to earn his living since
he was ten years old, at which time his father
had been killed in the mills, leaving Mrs. Brodsky
with a brood of young Brodskys, of whom
Ignatz was next to the eldest. It therefore devolved
on him to share a good part of the burdens
of the home, the elder brother, Paul, having
a wife of his own to care for.</p>

<p>When Ignatz let go his fist the other man was
caught wholly off his guard. He had no time
to raise his own fists in defense, though he was
just preparing to administer a kick to the boy
who had involved him in an argument.</p>

<p>Kalinski struck the ground sideways. The pit
boss was on his feet in a few seconds, uttering
a roar of rage. Ignatz calmly knocked him
down again, this time the blood spurting from
the boss's nose in a tiny crimson stream.</p>

<p>The next time Watski came up there was
blood in his eyes, as well as on his face and nose.
Ignatz knew full well that, unless he turned and
ran, the tables would be quickly turned on him,
for on equal ground he was no match for the
brawny pit boss.</p>

<p>"You loafer! You&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Watski made a rush for the boy, which Ignatz
dodged clumsily, hitting Kalinski in the side as
the latter passed him.</p>

<p>"All liars!" taunted Brodsky.</p>

<p>Kalinski wheeled sharply. Brodsky was off
his balance, but his fists were up ready to defend
himself. Yet he was not prepared for the
tactics adopted by the unscrupulous pit boss.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>Watski suddenly let go a vicious kick. It
caught Ignatz in the abdomen, doubling the boy
up and sending him moaning to the ground,
after which Watski started away on the run.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>





<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="center">STEVE MEETS WITH DISAPPOINTMENT</p>


<p class="cap">EARLY on the following morning Steve
Rush started out with a list of the other
mills in that vicinity, first having called
at the Brodskys to get the names of the other
foremen that Ignatz had promised to procure
for him.</p>

<p>Ignatz was not at home. He had not been
home all night and Mrs. Brodsky was greatly
worried. So was Steve. He knew that the boy
had intended to go directly home and help his
mother.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I will do. I will see if I
can find him. I was going on some matters of
my own, but they can wait."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brodsky was profuse in her thanks as
Steve started away to look for the missing boy.
Outside, the Iron Boy halted, wondering where
he should look. It was quite possible that
Ignatz had gone to the mills to work, and in that
case Rush would not be able to see him, for the
Iron Boy would not be allowed to enter the
yards unless he did so secretly, for the guard
would stop him now that his name was not on
the list of employs.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve thought of the hospital. He hurried
there at once. The lad knew all the surgeons
and nurses, having become well acquainted with
them while he was in the accident department.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of a boy named
Ignatz Brodsky?" was his first question on
meeting one of the ambulance surgeons.</p>

<p>"Brodsky? Brodsky? Seems to me that was
the name of the young fellow I picked up in the
street last night."</p>

<p>"Yes; that was the name," remarked one of
the young doctors present.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's too bad. Was he hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was unconscious when we brought
him here in the ambulance, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What was the matter&mdash;had he been hurt?"
questioned Rush excitedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, he had been&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"When he woke up he said he had been kicked
by a horse."</p>

<p>"May I see him?"</p>

<p>"He isn't here. He insisted on going to the
mills to work this morning. We thought, at
first, that he had been injured internally, but
I guess he didn't get a very bad kick, or he
surely would not be going to work to-day."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. His mother was
anxious about him. I will go and tell her that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he is all right now," announced Steve, hurrying
from the company's hospital.</p>

<p>Rush trotted along and soon reached the
Brodsky home, where he conveyed the news to
Mrs. Brodsky. At first she thought the boy was
deceiving her and that Ignatz had been really
seriously hurt even if he were not already dead.
The woman set up a wail of grief. Steve did
not know what else to do, so he grabbed her by
the shoulder and shook her.</p>

<p>The shaking evidently had the desired effect,
for Mrs. Brodsky ceased her wailings and began
to berate and threaten Ignatz, making promises
of what she would do to him when he got home
that night.</p>

<p>Steve argued with her, trying to explain that
Ignatz surely could not be to blame. He had
been kicked by a horse while on his way home
to help his mother. After a time the Iron Boy
left the widow in a much pleasanter frame of
mind. She even smiled at him as he shook hands
with her and told her what a good boy Ignatz
was and how good he had been to the Iron Boys.</p>

<p>Steve went away smiling, but he became
thoughtful as he walked briskly on. He could
not understand how it was that Ignatz had been
picked up at the place where the doctor said
he had found the boy. Surely he was not on his
way home, or he could not have been at that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
point. Steve was a shrewd boy and he began
to reason the thing out. He found himself unable
to get beyond the finding of the Polish boy,
so he gave up wondering, though he suspected
there was something more to the affair than he
knew about.</p>

<p>Rush boarded a car and started for the Lincoln
Iron Works, the nearest shops to where he
then was.</p>

<p>"It is a good, patriotic name," he mused.
"Surely I ought to be able to get a job there,
if there is anything in a name."</p>

<p>Reaching the mills he learned the name of the
superintendent from the gate-keeper, and thus
armed went directly to the office and asked to
see the superintendent. He was requested to
state his business, which he did frankly. The
word was soon brought back to him that no men
were needed.</p>

<p>"May I not speak to the superintendent myself?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"No; he has no time to give you," was the
answer from the superintendent's secretary.</p>

<p>Rush left the office with a keen sense of disappointment.
He decided to try the Republic
mills next. To reach them he took a short cut
over the hill, finally arriving at the Republic
mills four miles away, hot and tired. There he
was fortunate enough to catch the superintendent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
who was pointed out to him as he entered
the corridor of the offices.</p>

<p>Rush said he was looking for a place for himself
and his companion. The superintendent
looked the boy over critically, discovering at
once that Rush was no ordinary laborer.</p>

<p>"Have you ever worked in the mills?" asked
the executive.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; a short time."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"In the corporation's mills."</p>

<p>"What did you do there?"</p>

<p>"I was first in the accident department, investigating
accidents, and so was my friend.
From that we went into the mills to work. We
made the change from choice, so that we could
learn the business."</p>

<p>"In what department?"</p>

<p>"We started in the cinder pits, sir."</p>

<p>"Hm-m! How long did you work in the
pits?"</p>

<p>"Not quite a day," answered the Iron Boy,
flushing.</p>

<p>"Oh! What happened to you then?"</p>

<p>"We were discharged."</p>

<p>"For what reason?"</p>

<p>"Because an untruthful pit boss accused
us of blowing up a cinder pit, either through
carelessness or with design," answered Rush<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
truthfully. "There was not a word of truth in
it. If you will give us a place we will show you
that we are all right, and can be trusted to do
our work quickly and well."</p>

<p>"So you tried to blow up the mill in order
to learn the steel business, eh? And now you
want us to give you a chance to learn at our
expense?"</p>

<p>"Not at your expense; no, sir."</p>

<p>"Bring me a letter from your employer verifying
what you say and I will see what we can
do for you."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't care to ask it," replied the boy
promptly.</p>

<p>"Nor would I care to take you, under the
circumstances," answered the superintendent,
with equal promptness. "Good day. I have
no time to waste."</p>

<p>The executive hurried out of the office on his
way to the mills, leaving Steve standing there
with flushed face, uncertain just how he ought
to proceed.</p>

<p>Some of the men standing about were grinning
at the boy's discomfiture. Rush turned on
his heel and left the office, fearing to trust himself,
for fear he might say something unpleasant.
He walked proudly away, not stopping until
he was well out of the mill settlement. Then
he sat down on a rock and thought matters over.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
This getting a job, after one had been discharged,
was not the simple matter that he had
thought it. The situation was getting serious.</p>

<p>"But there are others. Surely, I shall be
able to find something to do in one of the mills."</p>

<p>Rush studied his list, and decided to visit the
Grey works next. That meant a tramp, unless
he wanted to wait nearly two hours for a steam
train to take him around the base of the mountains,
so he set out on foot again, for a straightaway
five-mile tramp.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when Steve
reached the place. He learned that the superintendent
was out of town. The assistant superintendent
was in the mills, so the boy sat down
to wait for him. Hours passed, but still the
Iron Boy sat reading a paper that he had found.</p>

<p>Shortly after five o'clock in the afternoon the
assistant entered the office. The mills were
closing then; that is, the day shift was coming
off and the assistant was in a hurry to get home.</p>

<p>Steve caught him before he got into his private
office and stated his business.</p>

<p>Very much the same conversation ensued as
had been the case at the Republic mills, save
that the questions were shot at him at rapid-fire
rate. He answered them fully as promptly,
so that but a few minutes were consumed in the
conversation.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"We have no place for you," answered the
assistant. "You may be telling the truth, and
you may not. I haven't the time to inquire
whether you are or not. Go back and tell your
story to your own superintendent, and if you
are any good he will put you to work again.
That's all."</p>

<p>Once more Rush walked from a mill office
beaten, although he did not realize his defeat.
He was tired, though not out of the race yet.
He did not even consider the advisability of taking
a train back to Steelburgh. Instead he
started out bravely at a swinging gait. A few
miles more or less was nothing to this strong-limbed,
athletic lad.</p>

<p>It was after dark when Rush, covered with
dust, grimy and tired, swung into the village
and strode to their boarding place.</p>

<p>Jarvis was waiting for him anxiously.</p>

<p>"Well, thank goodness you are back!" said
Bob, with evident relief. "I thought something
had happened to you."</p>

<p>"What's new?" interrupted Rush.</p>

<p>"Nothing. Oh, by the way, Ignatz has been
here."</p>

<p>"He has, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What did he say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing much, but he looked as I imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
the last rose of summer did when the cool nights
came along in the fall," laughed Bob.</p>

<p>"Is he all right?"</p>

<p>"No; I told you he didn't look very scrumptious."</p>

<p>"Did he say what happened to him last
night?"</p>

<p>"Yes, said he got kicked by a horse. But,
Steve, I guess that horse story will bear looking
into," laughed Jarvis.</p>

<p>"That is what I was thinking. Had he been
in a fight?"</p>

<p>"I shouldn't be surprised. His face didn't
show it, but he looked pretty seedy. How many
jobs did you get to-day?"</p>

<p>"None," answered Rush rather dolefully.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They didn't want us, Bob; that is, not without
a recommendation from our last employer."</p>

<p>"Meaning the Honorable Mr. Watski Kalinski?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," answered Rush dryly.</p>

<p>"I should enjoy reading the recommendation
that Watski would give us. It wouldn't be
worth much, would it, now?"</p>

<p>"I guess not," agreed Steve thoughtfully.
"Is Ignatz coming in this evening?"</p>

<p>"He said he might, though he had to go down
town on business, but he wouldn't say what."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"That rascal is up to something, Bob," said
Steve, with emphasis.</p>

<p>"He surely is."</p>

<p>"And I have an idea it has to do with us in
some manner. I hope he doesn't mix in this
affair. He will only get himself into trouble
and make it harder for us. If you see him first,
tell him so. If I see him I will give him a talking
to. He is a faithful friend, old chap."</p>

<p>"He is. Reminds me of a dog I had once.
The more you kicked him, the more he loved
you, and he had sharp teeth, too. So has Brodsky.
Say, you don't suppose he got into a
mix-up on our account, do you?"</p>

<p>"He may have."</p>

<p>"But tell me about your experience to-day?"</p>

<p>Rush did so, his friend listening attentively
until the story came to an end. Jarvis nodded
reflectively.</p>

<p>"I guess it is the mines for us, as they say
in Russia. What do you propose to do?"</p>

<p>"The same thing. I am going to keep at it
until I get a job for us, if I have to tramp up
and down the valley all the rest of the summer.
It will take more than one Kalinski to make us
change our plans, Bob. Are you with me?"</p>

<p>"Up to my neck!" replied Bob earnestly.</p>

<p>"That's the way I like to have you talk even
if it is a little slangy."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="center">SOMETHING HAPPENS TO THE BOSS</p>


<p class="cap">THE next day was a repetition of the previous
one so far as Steve's finding a position
was concerned. At every place he
was met by one of two answers. Either they
were not in need of any extra men, or else they
wished a letter from the corporation mills, giving
the facts of the discharge of the Iron Boys.</p>

<p>Rush was beginning to think hard. He had
discovered that getting on in the world was not
all smooth sailing; still he was not disheartened.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ignatz Brodsky had not been
idle. He had gone to his work and had stood
the abuse of Foley, and occasionally that of
Kalinski, though not in the latter's department,
without making any retorts. Ignatz's face was
stolid and emotionless.</p>

<p>That evening, however, having recovered
from the kick he had received, he went out first
in search of Superintendent Keating. The general
superintendent, he learned, was in New
York, and might return the next day or he might
not.</p>

<p>Disappointed, but still stolid, Ignatz betook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
himself over much the same route that he had
followed the night before. He did not meet
Kalinski, however, and after a while went home
to supper. Shortly after finishing his meal he
left the house. The widow Brodsky thought he
was going over to see the Iron Boys. Ignatz
had no such intention. He kept walking up and
down the streets, keeping a sharp lookout. At
last his search was rewarded. He espied Kalinski
standing on a street corner, talking with another
man.</p>

<p>The Polish boy smiled again and started
slowly toward Kalinski. But this time Kalinski
saw him coming. The brow of the pit boss
wrinkled, though he did not for a moment think
the boy would dare come near him after the experiences
of the previous night.</p>

<p>Ignatz kept on coming, just the same, though
he was not looking at the boss; rather were his
glances fixed reflectively on the pavement. The
boy came to a halt right in front of Kalinski
and looked up with an innocent expression on
his face.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want? Looking for more
trouble? Git out of this before I lose my temper
and do something to you."</p>

<p>"All liars!" announced Ignatz, with the same
calmness as before.</p>

<p>"What!" fairly howled the boss. "You little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
yaller dog, I'll beat the daylight out of you.
What do you want here?"</p>

<p>"This!" answered the Polish boy, smiting the
boss a terrific blow on the nose. It was the
same nose and the same spot on the nose that
had felt the fist of Ignatz once before.</p>

<p>Kalinski staggered back under the force of
the blow, howling with rage and pain. Ere
Brodsky could follow up the advantage thus
gained the boss was upon him.</p>

<p>No one interfered, for Kalinski was a bad
man when enraged and bystanders knew he
would brook no interference. When finally he
backed away Ignatz's face was a sorry sight.
The pit boss had given the boy a brutal beating.</p>

<p>"All, all liars!" he gasped, then turned and
staggered off toward home. But not a word
could the widow Brodsky obtain from him as
to the cause of the disfigurement. Next day
Ignatz was not seen at the mill. He remained
at home, moulding his face back into the semblance
of its former self.</p>

<p>Steve was late that night, as before, but he
had fared a little better. He had found a job
in a mill for himself and Bob. It was not much
of a job&mdash;merely carrying water for the men
in the tube mill at fifty cents a day.</p>

<p>The Iron Boy did not agree to accept the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
proffered employment, but said that in case he
found nothing better he would report for duty
on the following Monday morning if this would
be satisfactory. It was, and so the matter was
left.</p>

<p>Jarvis was out on the street again. The
bandages were off his hands, but he still wore
one over the upper part of his face. The lad
had gone out, hoping to meet Steve and walk
home with him. All at once Jarvis discovered
Brodsky walking ahead of him. As usual the
Pole was looking about him keenly.</p>

<p>"He is hunting for some one," muttered Bob.
"I think I will see what the little rascal is up
to. I'll bet he's up to some mischief."</p>

<p>Ignatz led Jarvis quite a chase, and it was
nearly nine o'clock when the Pole halted. Kalinski
was just coming out of the post-office. The
boss stopped short when he saw Brodsky, and
Brodsky stopped short as he caught sight of
the pit boss.</p>

<p>"Hello! I begin to smell a rat," chuckled
Bob. "I wonder what he and the boss can have
in common?"</p>

<p>Jarvis edged up a little closer. Brodsky and
the pit boss were slowly approaching each other.
Bob was almost trembling with excitement. The
very air vibrated with trouble.</p>

<p>"I actually believe that little runt is going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to pick a fight with the big fellow. Well, of all
the nerve I ever heard of! Why, Kalinski will
eat him alive."</p>

<p>Bob waited to see what would happen.</p>

<p>"All liars!" howled Brodsky, both feet leaving
the ground as he leaped straight at the boss.
Kalinski's fist grazed the Polish boy's cheek,
and the lad, with a quickness that would not
have been thought of him, planted his own fist
in the face of Kalinski.</p>

<p>There followed a quick exchange of blows,
Brodsky fighting in close with dogged determination.
Every time he landed a blow the
boy would shout, "All liars!"</p>

<p>This seemed to enrage Kalinski more than
anything else, and led him to renewed efforts
to down his antagonist. It could end but one
way. Bob Jarvis saw that as he stood clenching
and unclenching his hands, muttering to
himself: "It's a fair fight; you can't interfere.
It's a fair fight; you can't interfere!"</p>

<p>The Iron Boy was doing his best to keep out
of it, but he wished from the bottom of his heart
that Kalinski would turn on him, thus giving
Bob an excuse to even up old scores.</p>

<p>A big crowd had gathered and was urging on
the combatants, jeering, shouting in a chorus
of discordant yells. Suddenly Ignatz Brodsky
toppled over backwards, his arms waving feebly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
as he fell. He struck the ground heavily and
lay there moaning.</p>

<p>With a shout of triumphant rage Kalinski
sprang forward and began kicking the prostrate
boy with his heavy boots. The pit boss
was beside himself with rage, for Brodsky had
goaded him to the point of desperation. The
crowd apparently had no inclination to interfere
with this brutal act, for they continued their
shouting and jeering.</p>

<p>There was one, however, who did propose to
interfere. Such a scene was more than Bob
Jarvis could witness without taking a hand.</p>

<p>With a roar he hurled himself into the centre
of the circle that had been formed about the
combatants. A firm hand was laid on the arm
of the boss, and ere he knew what was occurring
he was thrown flat on his face in the dirty
street.</p>

<p>The crowd was not exactly sure whether it
approved of this or not, and, deciding that it
did not, began to hiss.</p>

<p>"He's a coward!" shouted Bob. "He, a full-grown
man, to thrash a boy, then kick him after
he is down! I am surprised that you loafers
could stand here and see it done without offering
to interfere."</p>

<p>"Look out! He's coming for you!" warned
a friendly voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>But Jarvis did not need the warning. He had
been watching the boss narrowly while scoring
the crowd, and he was ready for the next move.
As a matter of fact Bob did not believe Kalinski
would fight him. In this he was wrong, for
the Pole's rage blinded his better judgment.
His brutal instincts were in full control. Kalinski
was on his feet almost instantly, and with
a yell of rage he rushed the Iron Boy.</p>

<p>Jarvis stepped nimbly to one side, tripped
the man and once more threw him on his face.</p>

<p>The crowd jeered. This wasn't fighting.
They wanted to see blood flow. Their desires
were soon gratified, for no sooner had Kalinski
jumped to his feet again, and made a vicious
swing at Jarvis, than the boss received a stinging
blow on his sore nose from Bob's right, and
another on his right eye from Bob's left fist.</p>

<p>After that it was give-and-take. Neither man
gave ground in the slightest, but it was plain
that, while possessed of great muscular force,
the Pole lacked the science of the Iron Boy.
When the former did land it jarred Bob Jarvis
from head to feet, sometimes sending him staggering
backward, gasping for breath.</p>

<p>But Jarvis was full of pluck. Brodsky, at
this juncture, got unsteadily to his feet and elbowed
his way into the circle about the combatants.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"All liars!" he cried, whereat the crowd
picked him up bodily and threw him out over
the heads of those at the rear.</p>

<p>By this time Kalinski was getting slower in
his movements, and the strong fists of the Iron
Boy were beating a tattoo on the pit boss's face
and ribs. The crowd, seeing that Kalinski was
getting the worst of it, set up yells of disapproval.</p>

<p>"Throw him out! Put him in the river!"</p>

<p>With one common purpose the idlers surged
forward. At that moment some one began pushing
and elbowing through the crowd. Then
Steve Rush strode into the ring where the man
and the boy were battling for a finish.</p>

<p>Steve had been on his way home from his
day's tramp in search of a position when the
shouts of the crowd attracted his attention. He
hurried on to learn what was going on. His
surprise was great when he saw the bandaged
head of Bob Jarvis bobbing up and down in
the centre of the ring.</p>

<p>"Bob's at it again!" groaned Steve. "Will
he ever learn to keep out of trouble?"</p>

<p>Steve quickly noted the sinister attitude of
the crowd. He knew that in a moment they
would fall upon Jarvis, and it was a foregone
conclusion that the lad would be roughly handled.
Perhaps both boys would be roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
treated, but this did not deter Rush from springing
to the rescue of his companion.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" Steve shouted, as he leaped
into the narrowing space about the fighters.
"Stand back, every one of you. It's a fair
fight. Let them have it out. I don't know
what it is all about, but I know nobody is going
to interfere unless he wants to fight me!"</p>

<p>"Throw him out!" howled a voice. The cry
was quickly taken up by other voices. Steve
Rush was now the object of their disapproval.</p>

<p>"Men, I tell you to stand back! It will be
the worse for you if you don't."</p>

<p>Uttering a yell the idlers rushed the plucky
Steve.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="center">READJUSTING THEIR FINANCES</p>


<p class="cap">"POLICE! Police!" yelled a voice on the
outer edge of the circle.</p>

<p>"Police!" echoed the crowd, running
in all directions, for these foreigners held
the officers of the law in wholesome awe. They
had had experience with the uniformed police
on other occasions.</p>

<p>Kalinski did not run, for the very good reason
that he could not. Bob was following him
up too closely. Neither did Steve Rush nor
Ignatz Brodsky attempt to run away. It had
been Ignatz's voice that had called out the
warning. There were no police in sight, but
the boy, with quick wit, had cried out in order
to save Steve from the wrath of the mob.</p>

<p>Rush, as he shot a keen glance at the grinning
face of Ignatz, quickly comprehended.</p>

<p>"That's enough, Bob. Let him go. You are
even with him. Come on now&mdash;stop it!"</p>

<p>"All right, in a min&mdash;minute&mdash;&mdash;" thump!</p>

<p>"That's for the boy Ignatz, and"&mdash;thump&mdash;"that
for Rush, and"&mdash;&mdash;Bob uttered a grunt
as he launched a terrific blow at his adversary,
"that's for me!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The blow lifted Kalinski off his feet, laying
him flat on his back in the gutter.</p>

<p>"Back off!" commanded Steve, in a voice of
authority. "You have done your duty as you
saw it, and I guess a little more."</p>

<p>"Liar! Liar!" shrieked the Polish boy, hopping
about the fallen man, waving his arms,
almost beside himself with unholy joy.</p>

<p>"Take this boy away!" commanded Rush, as
he bent over and assisted Kalinski to his feet.
"I'm sorry, Kalinski, but I guess you got what
you deserved. Bob, how did this thing start?"</p>

<p>"In the first place Kalinski was fighting with
Ignatz&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He&mdash;he started it, the&mdash;&mdash;" interrupted
Kalinski.</p>

<p>"Don't say anything you will be sorry for,"
interjected Steve.</p>

<p>"After he had knocked Brodsky down he began
kicking the boy, and with the entire approval
of the crowd," added Jarvis. "Wouldn't
you have sailed into him if you had been in my
place?"</p>

<p>"I should have been a coward if I had not.
And now, Kalinski, I have a few words to say
to you. You have used us about as shabbily
as one person could use another. We are even
now; you have got what you deserve, but hereafter
keep away from us. Don't you dare speak<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to either of us. Try any tricks and it will be
the worse for you. Now get out of here!"</p>

<p>Steve gave the Pole a shove, Kalinski hurrying
away as fast as his weakened legs would
carry him, the fellow uttering threats and shaking
his fists as he went.</p>

<p>"We will go home now," announced Steve.
"You come with us, Ignatz," he added, taking
an arm of the Polish boy. "I am sorry this
thing happened, for I had hoped we should be
able to keep out of further trouble. We will
get a bad name if we don't stop having so many
rows."</p>

<p>"But how are we going to help it?" protested
Bob. "I can't stand around and see a boy
abused by a big brute like Kalinski, without taking
a hand."</p>

<p>"You did right, but I am sorry it occurred;
that's all."</p>

<p>Reaching their boarding place, Rush took Bob
and Ignatz to his room. He looked Jarvis over
from head to feet. The bandage about the latter's
head was now stained a dark red, where
the fists of the pit boss had pummeled him, while
the burns on the lad's hands, that had been
healed over, were now raw and painful. Rush
quickly bathed and redressed his companion's
wounds, then turned his attention to Brodsky.
The latter had received some pretty hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
knocks, and was also in need of treatment, which
Steve gave him at once.</p>

<p>None of them had any thought for supper,
which, in fact, had long since been finished in
the dining room of the boarding house. Rush
looked over the Pole with keen eyes.</p>

<p>"You have been fighting before to-night.
What for?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Kalinski, he liar; Foley liar&mdash;all liars!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. Is that why you were
fighting Kalinski?"</p>

<p>Ignatz nodded.</p>

<p>"You have been fighting him to avenge Bob
and myself, have you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I fight him."</p>

<p>"And you thought you could whip that big
brute?"</p>

<p>"I lick him yet."</p>

<p>"No; you let him alone. He has been properly
punished to-night. After this keep away
from him, or I will take you in hand myself.
What will your mother say when she hears of
this?"</p>

<p>"You tell her?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, but she will hear of it, and
I'll wager that she will give you a worse trouncing
than did Kalinski. I got a job for us to-day,
Bob."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"I got a job."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>Rush told him. Jarvis looked at his companion
a moment in silence, then burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"Fifty cents a day? Well, I must say we're
getting up in the world. How do you suppose
we are going to live?"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking of that. In fact I saw
the necessity of readjusting our finances before
we lost our jobs in the mills."</p>

<p>"I should say so," agreed Jarvis.</p>

<p>"We have been getting six dollars a week in
the mills here, and we are paying five apiece
for our board. If we take the new job we shall
be getting only three dollars a week and paying
out five."</p>

<p>"We'll have to make an assignment then,"
grinned Bob.</p>

<p>"I know a better way."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"Get a new boarding place, where we shall be
able to live within our means or thereabouts."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to live in the boarding house that
would come within our new means," grumbled
Jarvis. "This one is about the limit. It strikes
me that the best way to make money for ourselves
would be to start a boarding house."</p>

<p>"We are not in that line of business," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Steve shortly. "Ignatz, do you know of
a clean, cheap place where we can get board
and room?"</p>

<p>"Clean and cheap," Bob repeated. "They
don't make 'em. High-priced and dirty is the
rule."</p>

<p>Jarvis laughed loudly.</p>

<p>"Me know place," nodded Brodsky.</p>

<p>"Good, I thought you would. Where is it?"</p>

<p>"You come by my house."</p>

<p>"What's that? Your house?"</p>

<p>Ignatz nodded.</p>

<p>"Why, your mother would not take us. She
has a large family, and she would have no time."</p>

<p>"Come by my house. I fix it."</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Bob?"</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Steve."</p>

<p>"I am afraid your mother will not listen to
it, but I am sure it would please us very much
if she were to take us."</p>

<p>"Come, I make her."</p>

<p>"No, we won't do that. If she is willing and
can make us a price within our means, of course
we will go."</p>

<p>Ignatz had risen and was waiting for them
to go with him.</p>

<p>"Will you come, Bob?"</p>

<p>"Sure I will. Maybe I'll meet Kalinski on
the way," grinned Jarvis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The three boys started off for the Brodskys.
Mrs. Brodsky welcomed them, for she liked
these two open-faced young fellows for whom
her son held such an affection. He talked of
them most of the time when he was at home.
Ignatz was full of his subject to the bursting
point.</p>

<p>"My friends come live by us, Mother," he
said finally.</p>

<p>"What you say?"</p>

<p>"Steve and Bob come live by us."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brodsky opened her eyes.</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Now, to-morrow."</p>

<p>"It is this way, Mrs. Brodsky; we have to
find a new boarding place," Steve explained.
"We were asking Ignatz if he knew of a place,
and he said he thought you might be willing to
take us. We shall not be much trouble to you,
as we don't throw things about in our rooms.
We can sleep in one bed and we will make that
up if you do not have the time to do so."</p>

<p>"So?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brodsky was rather dazed. She never
had taken boarders before, and she hardly knew
what to say. She looked from the now eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
face of Ignatz to the expectant ones of the Iron
Boys.</p>

<p>"So?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"They come by us to-morrow," urged Ignatz.</p>

<p>"How about it, Mrs. Brodsky?"</p>

<p>She nodded slowly.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much. Now, what will you
charge us?"</p>

<p>"How much you give?"</p>

<p>"Whatever you think is right."</p>

<p>After reflection, Mrs. Brodsky said she
thought about two dollars a week would be
right. If that was too much she would charge
them less.</p>

<p>"No; that is too cheap," said Rush. "We
will give you two dollars and a half, gladly."</p>

<p>Mrs. Brodsky smiled benignly.</p>

<p>"Fine boys!" she said.</p>

<p>Ignatz was very happy. He began talking
joyously, until sternly reproved by his mother.
It was arranged that the boys were to move into
their new quarters early on the following morning.
The room assigned to them was small, but
the perfection of neatness. There was a clean,
white spread on the bed, a wash stand with a
clean towel laid over it, though, as Bob observed,
the pitcher and wash bowl had seen better
days. There was no carpet on the floor, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
this they did not mind. After making final arrangements
and paying over one week's board,
the Iron Boys took their departure, very well
content with what had been accomplished.</p>

<p>"We could just as well have gotten it for
two," said Jarvis after they had left the house.</p>

<p>"Yes, but I am not quite so mean as that.
That extra fifty cents apiece means a lot to us,
and I shall be glad to be there. We shall have
a happy day to-morrow, and perhaps we will
take that long-deferred picnic trip."</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="center">THE BOYS MEET WITH A SURPRISE</p>


<p class="cap">IGNATZ had gone when the Iron Boys made
their appearance at the Brodsky home
next morning, carrying a trunk between
them.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Mrs. Brodsky and all the
little Brodskys," greeted Steve, with a winning
smile, as the family met him at the door. The
coming of the boys was an event in that household.
The children were bashful, and not a
word could he get out of them. They hid behind
their mother's skirts, peering out at the
newcomers suspiciously.</p>

<p>After placing the trunk in their room the lads
went back for the second trunk, which was
Steve's. An hour later they were well settled
in their new quarters. They decided to wait
until after the noon meal before starting off
on their pleasure jaunt.</p>

<p>"I suppose our friend Ignatz is at work, Mrs.
Brodsky?" said Steve, sitting down in the parlor
for a chat with the widow.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, he is a good boy and you should be
proud of him. If ever I get a good position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
I shall give Ignatz a job that you will be proud
of."</p>

<p>"You'll be lucky if you get one for yourself,"
grunted Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Luck will change, old man. When a fellow
sets his mind on doing a certain thing, then
drives straight ahead, he's going to land what
he is after. No one can stop us, Bob."</p>

<p>"Well, all I've got to say is that some one
has given a pretty good imitation of stopping
us."</p>

<p>While they talked, Ignatz, instead of being in
the mill, as they supposed, was hanging about
the entrance to the company's offices. He had
heard, that morning, that the general superintendent
had returned from his trip, and young
Brodsky was determined to see him, even if he
lost a day's pay in his effort to do so.</p>

<p>There were two entrances to the office building,
but Ignatz had forgotten this. After waiting
nearly three hours he hailed a clerk who
came hurrying from the building, with the request
to tell him if Mr. Keating were coming
down that morning.</p>

<p>"He's in his office now, young man, but he
is very busy," was the answer as the clerk hurried
away.</p>

<p>Brodsky did not care whether the superintendent
were busy or not, for his own business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
was more important than anything that Mr.
Keating could possibly have on hand, according
to the way Ignatz reasoned it out.</p>

<p>The Pole climbed the steps leisurely, peered
into the corridor through the glass door, and
seeing no one there, entered. He saw no one
after he got in. Even the Iron and Steel Policeman
who usually stood guard in the hall was
not there. The man was in the office getting
some orders from the superintendent.</p>

<p>Ignatz, who did not know that the regular
entrance to Mr. Keating's office was through the
main offices, wandered on down the hall, slowly
spelling out the names on the doors. At last
he reached a door on which the word "Superintendent"
had been painted in large letters.</p>

<p>The long word bothered Ignatz, but he labored
with it until he managed to convey the sound of
it phonetically to his ears.</p>

<p>"Him there," he muttered.</p>

<p>Then Brodsky boldly turned the knob, opened
the door and entered.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating glanced up from his desk in surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, what do you want?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"All liars!" exclaimed Brodsky, striking a
dramatic attitude, legs apart, arms waving
wildly above his head.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating regarded the boy keenly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"Ignatz Brodsky."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"All liars!" persisted Ignatz.</p>

<p>"So I heard you remark before. Who is it
who has lied?"</p>

<p>"Kalinski, Foley&mdash;all liars."</p>

<p>"See here, young man, I am inclined to think
you are crazy, but if you have anything to say
to me, say it quickly and run along. Now what
do you want?"</p>

<p>"Steve Rush and Bob Jarvis, him not lie."</p>

<p>"Rush and Jarvis," repeated the superintendent.
"What about them?"</p>

<p>"They not blow up the cinder pits. Kalinski
say they do, then pouf, out they go!"</p>

<p>"I don't understand?"</p>

<p>Brodsky was dripping with perspiration from
his efforts to make himself understood.</p>

<p>"Has anything happened to Rush and Jarvis?"</p>

<p>The boy nodded.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Him fired. Him no get job. Kalinski,
Foley&mdash;all liars."</p>

<p>"The boys have been discharged, do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/iron4pic2.png" width="276" height="437" alt="All Liars! Exclaimed Ignatz." />
<p class="caption center extraspacebot5">&quot;All Liars!&quot; Exclaimed Ignatz.</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a><br /><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>"For lies. Mr. McNaughton him fire boys
because Kalinski tell lies."</p>

<p>The superintendent snatched the telephone receiver
from its hook.</p>

<p>"Give me Mr. McNaughton's office!" he commanded
sharply. "Hello, McNaughton, is this
you? Is it true that the two young men, Rush
and Jarvis, have been dismissed?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Brodsky caught the word faintly.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>The boy could not hear the reply in the telephone,
but he did hear the superintendent's next
remark.</p>

<p>"Come to my office at once. I wish to talk
with you. Brodsky, I am very much obliged
to you. Sit down. I may want to ask you some
questions after Mr. McNaughton gets here."</p>

<p>Ignatz, whose face had resumed its ordinary
stolidity, dropped into a chair, while his eyes
gazed vacantly through the window. Soon the
division superintendent came hurrying in.</p>

<p>"What is this you tell me about those boys
having been thrown out?" demanded Mr. Keating,
with a slight show of irritation.</p>

<p>"They are a bad lot, sir; a couple of impudent,
untrustworthy fellows. I wouldn't have
them in my division under any circumstances."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the first place, they disobeyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
orders and blew up the cinder pit after having
been warned not to put water on it while the
cinders were still hot. Then again, they had
several quarrels with the pit boss and the foreman.
Even in my office, where I called them to
hear their story, they answered me in a most
impudent manner."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" demanded Mr. Keating, in a
sarcastic tone.</p>

<p>"Well, it is all I can think of just now."</p>

<p>"Hm-m! A desperate pair, eh? McNaughton,
I thought you were a better judge of human
nature than that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"I mean, with all due respect to you, that I
don't believe a word of this. What did the boys
say&mdash;what excuse did they offer?"</p>

<p>"Denied it, of course."</p>

<p>"Tell me exactly what Foley and Kalinski
said in making their charges."</p>

<p>Mr. McNaughton did so. There was a slight
flush on his cheeks, brought there by the sharp
answers of the general superintendent.</p>

<p>As he finished, Ignatz suddenly came to life
again.</p>

<p>"All lies!" he exclaimed, waving his arms
over his head, after which he subsided.</p>

<p>"That will do, Brodsky!" commanded Mr.
Keating sternly, while his division superintendent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
flushed violently. "There is something
more to this affair than you seem to have
learned. These boys came to me with the highest
recommendations from President Carrhart.
They held responsible positions in the mines
and they came here to learn the steel business
after having followed the ore all the way down.
There is some mistake; depend upon that."</p>

<p>"I do not think there is any mistake, sir. I
know a bad boy or a bad man when I see him.
These boys are the limit. Why, sir, I hear they
made an attack on Kalinski on the street last
night, beating him nearly to death."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating looked grave.</p>

<p>"Lies!" muttered Ignatz.</p>

<p>"Young man, do you know where Rush and
Jarvis are?"</p>

<p>Ignatz nodded.</p>

<p>"Boys go work in Stevens' mills by Monday,"
volunteered the Pole.</p>

<p>"Can you fetch them here at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then do so. You need not say what I want
of them. Simply that they are wanted at the
office of the superintendent immediately."</p>

<p>Ignatz was out of the office on the run. He
burst into the house, waving his arms.</p>

<p>"Come by superintendent, quick!" he
shouted, dancing about excitedly.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="center">FACING THEIR ACCUSERS</p>


<p class="cap">"WHAT&mdash;what for?" demanded Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes, what does he want with
us?" questioned Jarvis, gazing with
suspicion upon the boy.</p>

<p>"Him want to see Iron Boys. Come quick."</p>

<p>"Are you sure, Ignatz?" asked Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes, superintendent him wait by the office."</p>

<p>"But why does he wish to see us?"</p>

<p>"I not tell. Him say I mustn't."</p>

<p>The Iron Boys laughed at this.</p>

<p>"I guess it is all right, Bob. Our friend has
given himself away. I shouldn't be surprised,
however, if Mr. Keating were sending for us to
express his disappointment at our failure to
make good. When did he return from his trip,
Ignatz?"</p>

<p>"Last night."</p>

<p>"You seem pretty well posted," laughed
Rush, bending a keen glance on the excited face
of the boy. "Very well; we will go with you,
although I rather dislike to do it. It seems as
though we were begging to be taken back,
whereas we know that such is not the case."</p>

<p>On the way to the office of the mining company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
Steve sought to draw out Brodsky as to
the causes that had led up to Mr. Keating's
sending for them, but Ignatz was as uncommunicative
as a Chinaman. He appeared almost
idiotic in his ignorance. This brought a smile
to the face of Steve. He knew the Pole had had
some hand in the affair, and Steve shrewdly
suspected that the boy was directly responsible
for the summons they had just received. However,
he pressed his inquiry no further. They
would soon know, for they were ascending the
steps to the office building.</p>

<p>Rush entered the reception office, sent in
his name and was bidden to enter. This he did,
followed by Jarvis, and, bringing up the rear,
was Ignatz Brodsky.</p>

<p>"How do you do, lads?" greeted the superintendent
cordially. "Will you be seated?"</p>

<p>Mr. McNaughton, at the first glance, was
somewhat taken aback. Here were two well-dressed,
gentlemanly young men. The boys
whom he had discharged had been clad in their
rough working clothes, hair unkempt and faces
streaked with the soot of the mills. There was
honesty and manliness in both faces now,
though the face of Bob Jarvis was considerably
the worse for wear, between his late accident
and his battle with Kalinski. The lads seated
themselves as requested by the superintendent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brodsky tells me that you wish to see us,
sir," said Rush, after greeting the division
superintendent.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do. What is this I hear about you
boys having been discharged?"</p>

<p>"I think Mr. McNaughton can answer that
question, sir," replied the Iron Boy, with the
suspicion of a twinkle in his eyes, as he glanced
at the division superintendent. The twinkle
was not lost on Mr. Keating, and he nodded,
while McNaughton flushed half angrily.</p>

<p>"Mr. McNaughton dismissed you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I presume he thought we ought to be discharged."</p>

<p>"You are evading the question."</p>

<p>"I have no such intention, sir. What is it you
wish me to say?"</p>

<p>"Tell me the story as it is. It is quite evident
that there has been a misunderstanding
here. Mr. McNaughton has been misled by some
one."</p>

<p>"I will tell all I know about it, and exactly
as it occurred. We began our work, evidently
having incurred the dislike of the foreman and
the pit boss before we even started in the pits."</p>

<p>"Why should you have gained their displeasure?"
interrupted Mr. Keating.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can only surmise. The foreman was enraged
when, as an inspector in the accident
department, I made a report which brought
criticism down upon him and led to his being
reduced."</p>

<p>McNaughton nodded. Already he began to
see a light.</p>

<p>"Now we are getting down to cause and effect,"
announced Mr. Keating, shooting a swift
glance at his division superintendent. "Go on."</p>

<p>"The two men began making it uncomfortable
for us at once. But I dislike to say these
things. It sounds as though we are whining.
We don't intend to do anything of the sort.
We are willing to take our medicine and smile,
no matter how bitter the dose."</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>Steve proceeded to relate the differences they
had had with Foley and Kalinski, but through
it all he did not mention the names of the foreman
and the pit boss. From this he went on
to tell what he knew about the warning, the
hurrying away of the two bosses and the eventual
explosion of pit number eight.</p>

<p>Bob Jarvis was asked to give his version of
the affair relating to the explosion only, which
he did, pointedly and concisely. To a fair judge
of human nature there was no doubt at all as
to the truth of the story the boys were telling.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, Jarvis, you say that you did not know
you were doing a dangerous thing when you
put the whole stream of water on the pit, do
you?"</p>

<p>"Do I?" repeated the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Do you think I would be foolish enough to
blow myself up, just for the sake of feeling myself
going up?" demanded the Iron Boy, with a
belligerent tilt to his chin.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating leaned back, laughing heartily.</p>

<p>"Well, candidly, I don't, though I do not think
even that consideration would stop you if there
were any good reason for your blowing yourself
up."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are not so far wrong at that,"
muttered Bob, coloring.</p>

<p>"There is another point that I should like
to ask you about," said Mr. Keating, turning
to Steve.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"How much truth is there in the statement
that you two assaulted Kalinski in the street
last night, beating him so badly that he was
unable to report for duty this morning? He is
in the hands of a doctor, I understand."</p>

<p>Steve colored again, and Bob laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"All lies!" exclaimed Brodsky.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The two superintendents turned sharply.
They had not noticed his presence before.</p>

<p>"Brodsky, what are you doing in here?" demanded
Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>Ignatz did not answer.</p>

<p>"If you speak again, until you are spoken to,
I will call the officer and have him put you out."</p>

<p>Ignatz subsided, settling far down in his
chair.</p>

<p>"It is both true and untrue."</p>

<p>"Explain."</p>

<p>"I will do so, though I was not present at
the beginning of the trouble. Jarvis can better
tell you more about that than I, and I do hope
that what we say will not get our friend, Ignatz
Brodsky, into trouble. He is a faithful
friend and an honest, well-meaning boy."</p>

<p>"I will decide that when I hear the story.
Jarvis, you may tell it."</p>

<p>"It was this way," began Bob. "I&mdash;we&mdash;had
been suspecting that Ignatz was watching
Kalinski and Foley ever since we were discharged
from the mill. He took our dismissal
very much at heart. He got hurt on the street,
the other night, and said he had been kicked
by a horse. I suspected that it was a two-legged
horse that had kicked him. Last night,
as I was walking along, I saw Ignatz. I followed
him. Then, soon after, I saw Kalinski<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
coming from the post-office. Both men stopped
and then I began to understand what was in
the wind. Well, sir, they sailed into each other
without a word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who started the fight?" interrupted Mr.
Keating.</p>

<p>"Both," answered Bob promptly.</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"I didn't think it was my business to take a
hand, though I wanted to. The little fellow held
his own pretty well for a time, but the boss was
too big and strong for him. Then Kalinski
knocked the boy down, and began to kick him."</p>

<p>"The ruffian!" exclaimed Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, that's what I thought; and not a
man of the crowd that had gathered went to
the boy's assistance. They seemed to think it
was a barrel of fun. Well, sir, you know I
couldn't stand for that."</p>

<p>"I should say not."</p>

<p>"I just sailed in, and we had it right and left
all over the street. He had a sore nose and I
played a tune on that for a little while. I had
a sore head, where I got burned the other day
in the mill, and Kalinski played rag-time on
that. After awhile there wasn't any more music
left in either of us, except in our ears. Mine
were ringing like a church bell at Christmas
time."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time both superintendents were
laughing at the humorous recital of the Iron
Boy. Even Steve Rush was smiling, despite his
efforts to be serious.</p>

<p>"What next?" questioned Mr. Keating, brushing
his hand across his face to hide his laughter.</p>

<p>"I wound up with a tattoo on his face, and
Kalinski went to the ground, and I didn't kick
him either. It came pretty close to being a
fight."</p>

<p>"I should say it was a real fight," remarked
the superintendent dryly. "Then Rush had no
part in it at all?"</p>

<p>"He came in when we were having it hardest,
and the crowd was getting ready to jump
on me because they saw I was getting the best of
the pit boss. Rush held the crowd back so I
should have fair play; that's all."</p>

<p>"What was Brodsky doing all this time?"</p>

<p>"He was shouting 'liars!' most of the time.
But when he saw that the crowd were going
against me, he called 'police,' and the crowd
ran away. (Much obliged, Ignatz. I hadn't
thought to thank you for helping me out before.)
I had to do it. You would have done the same
as I did, Mr. Keating, because you're a
man&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're right, I should have, Jarvis!" exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the superintendent, bringing the flat of
his hand down on his desk with a resounding
whack.</p>

<p>"At any rate, you can't fire me because I'm
not working for you any longer."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you are. McNaughton, what do
you think about these boys now?" demanded
the general superintendent, turning to his division
superintendent.</p>

<p>"I don't think; I know. I have done these
boys a very great injustice and I am willing and
ready to make amends in any way that I can.
I don't know how I could have been so deceived."</p>

<p>"Naturally, not knowing them, you took the
word of your foremen. I am not inclined to
blame you under the circumstances. But, boys,
I am sorry this has happened. I apologize to
you, for you have been very badly used. Do I
understand that you have taken another place?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; that is, we can have the place if
we wish it. There is no obligation on our part
to go if we do not wish to."</p>

<p>"Why did you not come straight to me with
your story at once?"</p>

<p>"It did not seem right to go over Mr. McNaughton's
head. It seemed an unmanly thing
to do."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating nodded at the other man, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
much as though to say, "I told you so." What
Keating said aloud was:</p>

<p>"Not many would have followed that course,
McNaughton."</p>

<p>"No, sir," agreed the assistant superintendent.</p>

<p>"We shall have to take some action in the
cases of Foley and Kalinski. Each is equally
to blame."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"My inclination is to dismiss them summarily.
Have they families?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; large families."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m," reflected Mr. Keating. "That
makes it rather difficult to do with them as I
otherwise should. However, they must be punished.
I'll tell you; they must both be reduced
to the ranks. I do not want any such men in
positions of responsibility in mills of which I
am the head. It is not safe. Put them at whatever
they can do."</p>

<p>"They will quit, sir."</p>

<p>"Let them! I hope they do. It relieves me
of a disagreeable job that sooner or later it
will be necessary to tackle. Brodsky, you are
a good boy. I shall look into your case and
see what can be done for you."</p>

<p>"Then do we go to work?" asked Jarvis.</p>

<p>"You are at work already. I will see to it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
that you are paid for the time you have been
off. It was a rank injustice. But I am going
to shift you to another department. How would
you like to try the blast furnaces?"</p>

<p>"We are ready to go wherever you put us,"
answered Rush.</p>

<p>"You proved that by taking the job in the
pits. That will take them out of your department,
McNaughton."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am sorry, too, for I rather hoped
to be able to make up for my shortcoming in
this matter."</p>

<p>"You were not to blame, sir," said Steve.
"We are very grateful to you for your kind
words to-day. Shall we begin in the furnaces
to-morrow, Mr. Keating?"</p>

<p>"No, Monday will do. In the meantime I will
have your time corrected, so that you will have
lost no time by the mistake that threw you out.
McNaughton, you will attend to Foley and
Kalinski at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The Iron Boys rose.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Mr. Keating. We are more
grateful than we know how to express. We will
show you that we are both appreciative, and I
hope you won't have to be told that we are not
doing our duty."</p>

<p>Bowing their thanks the boys left the office,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Brodsky having already sneaked out ahead of
them. They espied him lurking around the turn
in the hall, watching for their coming.</p>

<p>"Ignatz, you rascal!" called Bob. "I ought
to give you a good thumping. You don't deserve
to be let off with a scolding. How would
you like to have me tell your mother you have
not been at work to-day?"</p>

<p>"She know when she git my wages."</p>

<p>"No she won't," interjected Steve, "for I am
going to pay your wages for just this one day.
You come with us. We are going on a picnic."</p>

<p>Three happy boys started off for a place they
knew of up the river, where they were going
to spend the afternoon. Steve bought some
cakes and sandwiches at a baker shop, and a
few bottles of mineral water, then off they went
for their holiday.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="center">BY THE ROARING FURNACES</p>


<p class="cap">IN the daytime a row of tall black, cone-shaped
chimneys might be seen across the
river from the mills themselves. At night
these chimneys were pyramids of yellow and
red fire.</p>

<p>These were the blast furnaces. In them, the
ore, as it came from the mines far away on the
Minnesota iron ranges, was reduced to pig or
pig iron, by smelting at a temperature of fifteen
hundred degrees centigrade&mdash;about twenty-seven
hundred degrees Fahrenheit. This great
temperature boils the slag or impurities out of
the metal, and after it has been drawn off into
ladles it becomes "pig."</p>

<p>From the blast furnaces the pig, red-hot in
its molds, is conveyed to the open-hearth furnaces,
where it is subjected to a still further
boiling process at the same temperature as before,
and then it is steel. Steel is pig-iron combined
with carbon and with the impurities boiled
out.</p>

<p>It was to the blast furnaces that the Iron Boys
were assigned, and they were to take the night
trick. As they made their way that night<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
through the yards of the mill, where engines
were shrieking their warnings, cars were thundering
here and there, long trains of red-hot
metal rumbling over the hot metal bridge from
the blast furnaces to the mills, while the flames
were leaping skyward from the blast furnaces,
Steve halted for a moment to gaze on the scene.
Neither boy ever had been in the yards after
dark, and the scene was one never to be forgotten.</p>

<p>"Which furnace do we work in?" wondered
Bob.</p>

<p>"Number four, I believe."</p>

<p>"Then that must be the fourth one."</p>

<p>"Naturally it wouldn't be the fifth," answered
Steve, with a laugh.</p>

<p>They hurried across the bridge, for it was
already time they were reporting to the head
melter at the furnace, and being late meant
being docked, for there is no sentiment in the
steel mills. Every man was expected to do his
full duty and a little more. Most of them did
the latter.</p>

<p>A scene of activity and apparent confusion
met their gaze as they neared the towering
blast furnaces with their heating stoves sixty
feet high on either side of them.</p>

<p>Men with barrows were rushing about, bells
clanged as the charge was ready to hoist on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
the top of the furnace to be dumped into its
never-satisfied mouth. The ore was carried up
by another skip. Through the stoves roared a
gas flame, leaping, licking, here and there reaching
out a forked tongue as though in search of
fresh prey. The odor of gas was well-nigh overpowering
to the Iron Boys, for they were not
used to it.</p>

<p>The head melter, standing close up against
the furnace, clad in a rubber coat and wearing
green goggles, was peering into the furnace
through a peep hole, while a stream of water
from a hose was constantly played over his
body. His face seemed to rest almost against
the plates, and the bosh on which he was standing
was so hot that the steam rose in a cloud
about him.</p>

<p>Two men were inserting the prodding rod
against the dolmite that plugged the ore hole
near the bottom of the furnace. The perspiration
was running in rivers down their half-naked
bodies.</p>

<p>"The drill! The drill!" shouted a choking
voice.</p>

<p>A compressed air drill was brought, a dolly-rod
inserted, and then the dolmite was drilled
to a thin shell.</p>

<p>"Stand back!" warned the head melter in a
hoarse voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I reckon something is going to happen,"
cried Jarvis in his companion's ear. The roar
of the furnaces and the gas in the huge stoves
made his voice sound weak and far away.</p>

<p>Steve moved back a little, pulling Jarvis after
him. Flush with the edge of a raised platform
of fire-brick and steel, over which extended little
gutters packed with sand, stood a string of
flat cars each holding an immense ladle. The
gutters led directly into these ladles.</p>

<p>"That is where the iron goes, through those
gutters and into the ladles," explained Rush.
"It runs like water, though I have never seen
them make a cast."</p>

<p>Just then a warning cry sounded as the dolly
broke through the clay dam that holds the metal
in the furnace.</p>

<p>Fire, scorching, burning fire leaped from the
opening made with the dolly. The air was filled
with brilliant, hissing stars as large as the palm
of a man's hand. Some whirled like pin-wheels;
others, holding their perfect shape, described
graceful curves in the air, or exploded.</p>

<p>Men shaded their eyes, drew themselves together,
and tried to shrink away from the terrific
heat. But there was no avoiding it. The
monkey-man who had broken through the clay
dam staggered away from the opening thus
made, shouting hoarsely for water.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Following the explosive stars, a river, almost
blood-red, burst from the furnace with a roar,
quickly changing into a river of saffron. Hissing
and snapping the molten metal burned its
way along through the sand-packed gutters, and
shot from the ends of the gutters and into the
waiting ladles on the flat cars at the foot of the
platform. Everywhere the air seemed filled
with fiery shapes reaching for human prey. Under
foot there was danger on every hand, for
a single misstep would plunge one into this all-consuming
flood. The slag, or as much of it as
possible, ground its way much more slowly,
along another channel, to be gathered up and
used over for other purposes at some later day.</p>

<p>As one ladle was filled the waiting train would
move up, bringing a new set of cars under the
ends of the gutters, and when at last all the cars
had been loaded the train moved off, the ladles
glowing in the darkness of the night, until in the
distance they became mere eyes of fire.</p>

<p>The Iron Boys drew a deep sigh as the operation
was concluded. Four hours would elapse
before another cast would be made from number
four furnace, but here and there along the
row of huge cones stars were bursting, streams
of hot, yellow lava flowing and men shouting,
snarling or begging for water.</p>

<p>"It is terrible, yet grand!" exclaimed Steve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Rush, wiping the perspiration from his brow.
Even where they stood, at one side of the furnace,
the heat was well-nigh unbearable.</p>

<p>"It strikes me as being grandly hot," answered
Jarvis. "Whew, a fellow doesn't need
his winter underclothing on in this job, does
he?"</p>

<p>"The furnace men don't seem to wear any
at all," laughed Rush. "I should think they
would burn their skin off. I don't know whether
I can stand this game or not, but I'll try it. I
wonder what we are going to do?"</p>

<p>"I will find out from the foreman."</p>

<p>The foreman was not on hand at the moment,
but the head melter, known under the name of
Pig-Iron Peel, had received orders regarding
the Iron Boys.</p>

<p>He motioned them to approach, when a furnace
hand told him who they were. He asked
the name of each boy in a hoarse, gruff voice.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" demanded Jarvis.</p>

<p>"I'm the Pig," answered the melter, his red
face wrinkling into a grin, which was quickly
smoothed out as if the effort hurt him.</p>

<p>"Pig-Iron Peel," he added.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" roared Bob immoderately.</p>

<p>Steve nudged him to be quiet.</p>

<p>"We are ready to work if you will tell us
what to do," said Rush.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can pack the sand gutters after the
charge is loaded into the ladles. Either of you
ever worked on a furnace before?"</p>

<p>"No, sir," answered the boys.</p>

<p>"You, what's your name&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"Jarvis."</p>

<p>"Well, Jarvis, I'll put you up on the charging
platform. You won't have much to do
there&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where is the charging platform?" interrupted
Bob.</p>

<p>"At the top of the furnace, fifty feet up there
in the air. How do you like it?"</p>

<p>"Fine!" answered Jarvis, though without his
usual enthusiasm. "What am I do when I get
there?"</p>

<p>"Dump the charges into the furnace. The
skips you have nothing to do with, except to
ring a bell when you are ready for them. They
will dump four loads of red ore into the furnace;
then you throw in a layer of coke and
limestone, the latter being called 'flux.' This
makes what we call the charge. Is that clear?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do I do then?"</p>

<p>"You do it all over again and you keep doing
it until another man comes to take the job off
your hands."</p>

<p>"How do I get up there?"</p>

<p>"Climb the ladder."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! Lucky for me I'm on the night trick,
so I can't see, or I'd surely fall off."</p>

<p>"Rush, the sand man will show you about the
troughs. Jarvis, you hike upstairs. Tell the
man I have up there that you are to relieve him.
He will show you about operating the levers.
Have him put in a charge while you look on."</p>

<p>"Is there any light up there, so I can see
what I am doing?"</p>

<p>"You will have light enough," grinned Pig-Iron
Peel. "You won't have any reason to
complain about either light or heat. This charging
business is a continuous performance day
and night, until the furnaces have to be shut
down for cleaning. For your information I will
tell you that the iron, being the heaviest, sinks
to the bottom of the furnace as it is melted.
The cinders trickle down after it, forming what
is called the heart. The latter are tapped off
every two hours, the iron every four hours. If
you are going to be furnace men you will want
to know all these things at the start."</p>

<p>"Thank you for the information. It is all
very interesting," answered Steve.</p>

<p>"And very hot," added Jarvis. "With your
permission I'll go aloft now, sir."</p>

<p>"Go on, and look sharp that you don't fall
off," warned the head melter.</p>

<p>"I'll cling to the sheets, sir."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob, after the ladder bad been pointed out
to him, began to climb. He had not gone far
before he discovered that the rungs of the iron
ladder were hot. They were so much so that
he yelled, "ouch!" removing first one hand and
then the other to rub it on his trousers. He
was unable to keep both hands on the ladder
for any great length of time.</p>

<p>Bob began to growl, and he kept up his growling
all the way up the fifty-foot ladder. Finally
he decided he must have gone about a hundred
feet, instead of fifty and halting he shouted,
"Hello!"</p>

<p>"Hello, yourself," answered a gruff voice
from the cloud above. "What do you want?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of what I want, but
rather what I am going to get. Are you the
feeder?"</p>

<p>"I'm charging, if that's what you mean."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't charge too much I'll come
up and be shown," laughed the irrepressible
Bob.</p>

<p>"Quit that fooling or I'll throw a bag of coke
down on you."</p>

<p>Bob ran nimbly up the rest of the ladder, and
a moment later stood facing a soot-covered fellow
of about his own age.</p>

<p>"Say, did you mean that about the coke?"</p>

<p>"You'll find out whether I did or not, if&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, pard, if you get funny I'll put
you in with the coke and the&mdash;the limestone.
I'll bet they'd never get the impurities out of
the iron after you once got in it. It would be
pig forever afterwards. Ha, ha! How's that?"</p>

<p>"You're too fresh, that's what's the matter
with you," growled the charging boy. "Git
busy here; I'm going down. I don't belong up
here anyway, and I'm glad of it."</p>

<p>"Don't say that," protested Jarvis, with
mock seriousness. "It is a matter of sincere
regret to me that this isn't your regular job.
I'd just as lief be down on the ground carrying
water, as up here feeding the mouth of the furnace.
The boss monkey down below said you
were to show me what to do."</p>

<p>With a grunt of disapproval the charging boy
instructed Jarvis in his duties, then with a "so-long,"
hurried down the ladder, leaving the
Iron Boy alone in his glory.</p>

<p>Bob glanced about him curiously. Directly
over his head, it seemed, flared the flames from
the huge stove. Every now and then the great
flame would swoop down a fiery tongue as if
bent upon lapping him up. Bob instinctively
ducked as the breeze carried the flame down
toward him. He believed that a gust of wind
would surely bring the flame on him, which he
was certain would be the end of Bob Jarvis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>Off to the right and to the left of him were
other swaying pillars of fire from the stoves of
the other furnaces, and over on the opposite
side of the river black smoke and red fire poured
from the funnels of the open-hearth furnaces
there. Bob himself was enveloped in a dense
cloud of suffocating smoke, which, breathed into
his lungs, set him coughing and choking.</p>

<p>"I wish I had stayed fired!" he muttered.
"This is worse than the cinder pits."</p>

<p>Time passed quickly, however, and between
watching the skiploads of ore as they shot up
to him with disconcerting suddenness, and dodging
the flames from the number four stove, Jarvis
was kept reasonably busy.</p>

<p>Down below Steve, on hands and knees, was
patting the sand in the gutters into place,
smoothing it off so that there should be no projections
to catch and retard the flow of the hot
metal when the next cast was made. He found
Pig-Iron Peel, despite his rough appearance, to
be a kind-hearted man. This was a distinct relief
after the experience of the lads in the cinder
pits under two bosses who had lost no
opportunity to do them harm. Now and then
the head melter would step over to instruct the
Iron Boy in his duties, and even at the distance
from the furnace that Steve was working the
heat was well-nigh unbearable. He was obliged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to make frequent trips to the water barrel, and
now and then he showered himself from head
to foot with the ready hose. The skin was peeling
from his face and his work clothes were
burned through in many places.</p>

<p>"Stand by for the tap!" commanded Peel.</p>

<p>Rush was so busy that he did not hear the
command. He did hear the tap, tap of the mall
as it drove against the prodding rod, but this
held no special significance for him. In the
darkness preceding the cast the others did not
observe him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, with a roar, the saffron flood burst
through the clay dam. Millions of hissing stars
leaped into the air and a river of molten metal
swooped down on Steve Rush in its all-consuming
flight.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="center">MENACED BY A DOUBLE PERIL</p>


<p class="cap">"LOOK out!" roared the warning voice of
the head melter.</p>

<p>Steve turned just in time to see a
wall of golden metal almost towering over him.
Even his quick mind did not grasp the meaning
of the scene until it was too late. His
muscles refused to obey his command, and for
once in his life the Iron Boy stood with a sensation
in his heart that was not far removed
from fear. He did not know which way to turn
for safety, even had he possessed the strength
to escape from his perilous position.</p>

<p>Yells and shouts of warning from all sides
merely served to confuse him the more. Had
it been daylight Rush no doubt would have
quickly thrown himself to one side.</p>

<p>Suddenly something came whirling through
the air. The Iron Boy did not see it, and it is
doubtful if more than one man about the furnace
did. It was a dark object, and it smote
Steve across the chest with terrific force.</p>

<p>The Iron Boy staggered backward, toppled
over just as the molten flood from the furnace
went hissing past. The boy did not stop there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
His body began rolling down the incline leading
to the jumping-off place, below which the
tracks were located. His body shot over ahead
of the metal, for that had to follow a circuitous
course. There was little danger of its overtaking
him, as a dam at the lower end was intended
to check its flow until the train had backed in
with the ladles to receive the ore. This train,
as it chanced, was at the moment backing down
to the furnace at high speed, for the train was
late and the tapping of the furnace, the engineer
knew, could not be delayed without perhaps
doing great damage to the metal.</p>

<p>Bob Jarvis, from his perch high in the air,
had caught sight of the scene that was being
enacted below as a draught of air tore aside
the curtain of smoke that during the evening
had blotted out the lower end of the furnace.
Forgetful of his duty up there Bob
sprang to the ladder. He did not wait for the
hot rungs this time; but, grasping the sides of
the iron ladder, shoes on the outside pressed
tight against the uprights, he dropped out of
sight of the charging platform like a stone. The
rapid descent was burning the skin from his
palms and an odor of burning leather reached
his nose faintly as the iron sides of the ladders
burned through the shoes pressed against it.</p>

<p>Bob landed with a jolt. He dropped to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
furnace floor, but was up in a twinkling. Leaping
the saffron river he bolted across the intervening
space and sprang straight out into the
air, right in the face of the approaching train
of flat cars thundering in.</p>

<p>There was a ten-foot drop to the ground.
Jarvis did not know whether he was going to
land in a pit of hot ore, cinders, or on a fence
of iron that would end his career right there.</p>

<p>By the light from the opened furnace, as he
was falling, he saw the tracks below him and
the form of Steve Rush lying stretched across
them. Bob saw something else too&mdash;the long
line of flat cars swooping down on Steve.</p>

<p>Jarvis landed on all fours. He did not waste
time in glancing about to see where the train
was. Instead, he grabbed Rush, pitching him
headlong out of the way. Steve landed on his
head, pivoted for a second, and then fell over on
his back.</p>

<p>Jarvis straightened up and started to leap
clear of the track when he was struck a terrific
blow from behind. The force of the blow lifted
the boy from the tracks. As everything about
him began to grow black he felt himself being
hurled through the air.</p>

<p>There was no time to shout, nor opportunity
to help himself. Bob had been struck by the
train, the end beam of the leading car having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
caught him squarely across the hips. Bob
landed some ten feet beyond the spot where
Steve was lying. The latter, however, had been
barely stunned. About the time Bob went soaring
over his head, Rush scrambled to his feet
and hands then got up limping a little.</p>

<p>But Steve was dazed. The glare of the intense
light from the open furnace blinded his
eyes so that he could not see a thing distinctly.
He heard the shrill shriek of the shifting engine,
then four quick, warning blasts. The Iron Boy
ducked instinctively at the same time leaping to
one side.</p>

<p>By this time objects began to grow out of the
glare with more or less distinctness. Steve
rubbed his eyes and blinked.</p>

<p>"I wonder what happened? I know&mdash;I got
an awful rap from something."</p>

<p>His arms ached and his chest was so sore
that the touch of his clothes gave him pain.
About that time Rush discovered that raising
his arms was attended with more or less pain
also.</p>

<p>"Hello! Something is going on over there
by the furnace. Now what in the world has
happened? If Kalinski were anywhere about I
should think he had been trying some of his
tricks on me again."</p>

<p>Kalinski was not there, but three men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
had climbed down from the brick and steel platform
about the furnace came running around
the lower end, heading for the spot where the
Iron Boy was standing.</p>

<p>"Hi, whom are you looking for?" Steve
called.</p>

<p>"Hello, who's that?" answered a voice.</p>

<p>"It's Rush. I'm all right. Something must
have hit me and knocked me off the platform."</p>

<p>"I guess something did hit you," answered a
voice that Steve recognized as belonging to the
head melter, Pig-Iron Peel. "Where is the
other boy?"</p>

<p>"What other boy?"</p>

<p>"Jarvis?"</p>

<p>"Why, he's up at the top of the furnace on
the charging platform."</p>

<p>"Not much he ain't!" answered Peel. "He's
down here, somewhere."</p>

<p>"Down here?" wondered Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did he get down here?"</p>

<p>"He came over after you. Never saw such a
quick move in my life. What's bothering me is
how he ever got down the ladder soon enough to
get you. He saved your life all right, boy."</p>

<p>"Hello, Bob!" shouted Steve, realizing all at
once that something more had occurred than he
knew about. "Bob!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hello," answered a faint voice off in the
darkness of the yard.</p>

<p>Rush darted forward, followed by the head
melter and his two companions.</p>

<p>"Where are you, Bob?"</p>

<p>"I'm here&mdash;what's left of me, and that isn't
much."</p>

<p>They found Bob on his knees, gingerly rubbing
the injured portion of his anatomy.</p>

<p>"Are you hurt?" begged Steve solicitously.</p>

<p>"Hurt? Why, I'll never be able to walk again
as long as I live! I'll have to sit around all the
rest of my life."</p>

<p>Bob's companion was helping him to his feet,
bringing groans of pain from the unfortunate
Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Don't touch my hands; they're skinned. Oh,
what a fool I am! Let me alone; don't you see
I'm skinned alive?"</p>

<p>With Steve on one side of him, and Pig-Iron
Peel on the other, Jarvis was led over to the
stairs that extended up to the platform.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell me what happened to
you?" demanded Steve.</p>

<p>"Ask the boss. I don't know. I think I must
have been kicked by something. Are there any
mules in the yards."</p>

<p>"No; no mules," replied Peel. "You were
hit by a train."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't mean it? I'll bet the train was
wrecked! Nothing&mdash;no train could hit an object
with the force that I was hit and not be bucked
off the track. That's so; I remember, now, I
was getting you off the track when I was
struck."</p>

<p>"Yes; you would have been run over and
killed on the spot if Jarvis hadn't got you when
he did. How did you get down from the charging
platform?" demanded the melter, turning to
Bob.</p>

<p>"I shot the chutes and it was the hottest shoot
I ever took. Look at my hands."</p>

<p>"So I fell on the track, did I?" questioned
Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How did I happen to do that?"</p>

<p>"You fell over the edge right in front of the
train."</p>

<p>"Yes, but something hit me and knocked me
over. I remember getting a whack something
like that described by Bob, only I wasn't struck
in the same place."</p>

<p>"I hit you," spoke up the head melter.</p>

<p>"You did?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There wouldn't have been so much as
a grease spot left of you, by this time, if I
hadn't."</p>

<p>"What did you hit me with?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>"I threw the dolly at you, and it did the business.
It knocked you plumb over on your back.
The cast was right on top of you when I let
go the dolly. You know the rest."</p>

<p>"Then you saved my life, too, Mr. Peel?"</p>

<p>"Well, something of that sort," grinned the
head-melter.</p>

<p>"We're both entitled to hero medals, you
see," added Bob.</p>

<p>"Thank you; I owe you both one for that.
Well, Mr. Peel I am ready to go to work. How
about you, Bob?"</p>

<p>Jarvis glanced up to where the ladder disappeared
in the veil of smoke high above them.</p>

<p>"If I had an elevator I'd be all right, but I'll
try it."</p>

<p>"You need not go up if you don't feel like it,"
said the melter. "I will send one of the furnace
men up to finish your trick, if you wish."</p>

<p>"No, I'll go myself. There won't be any
trouble about getting down. I can fall down,
but the difficulty will be in climbing that ladder
with the skin all off my hands. Say, those
rungs are hot. Why don't you cool them off?"</p>

<p>"We'll play the hose on you while you are
going up if you want."</p>

<p>"You'd better not, if you know what is good
for you. If you even breathe on me I'll fall off.
Well, here goes!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>Rush, followed his companion to the foot of
the ladder.</p>

<p>"Are you sure you are all right, Bob?" he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"No; I am not all right, but I'm right enough
to beat this game. I can't do any more than
break my neck, and I guess that isn't breakable.
We have had our initiation ceremonies; now
maybe we'll go along for a time without anything
happening. Here goes!"</p>

<p>Bob, with evident effort, began climbing.
Once he seemed to lose his grip and Steve, believing
he was going to fall, started to run up
the ladder.</p>

<p>"Quit that!" howled Jarvis, feeling the vibration
on the ladder. "What are you trying to
do&mdash;throw me off?"</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you needed some help."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you when I do. What I want most
just now is to be let alone."</p>

<p>Rush stepped back to the platform, but he remained
standing there until finally Jarvis disappeared
in the cloud of smoke and gas up near
the top of the blast furnace. Then he turned
back to the furnace work.</p>

<p>"What next, Mr. Peel?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, if you think you can get out of the
way quick enough, you can begin to patch up
the gutters again."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The hot metal train had long since pulled
away over the bridge, on its way to the mills,
where the ingots would either be rolled in their
crude state or placed in the open-hearth furnaces
to be transformed into ingots of steel.</p>

<p>"I guess I can keep out of the way, now that
I know what to keep out of the way of."</p>

<p>"I'll put you on the dolly to-morrow, and
make a monkey-man of you. If you don't get
incinerated we'll make a real man of you."</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>Peel did not know whether the remark was
intended to be sarcastic or not, and Steve's impassive
face gave him no clue to the truth.</p>

<p>For the rest of the night each of the Iron
Boys labored faithfully, and that morning, the
moment they struck their beds, they instantly
fell into the deathlike sleep of the laborer in the
steel mills.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="center">THROUGH THE MELTING POT</p>


<p class="cap">"I'VE got a new job for you," said the head
melter to Steve, when the Iron Boys reported
for duty on the following evening.</p>

<p>"Am I to be the monkey?"</p>

<p>"No, not to-day. I'll let you be the ladle
man."</p>

<p>"What does he do?"</p>

<p>"Not much. He stands with a ladle in his
hands, scooping from the molten metal, as it
bursts out through the clay dam, all the cinders
and slag he can pick up. Every little bit helps.
You've got to watch lively, or you will be burned
to a crisp before you pick up the first ladle full,"
was the cheerful additional remark of the head
melter.</p>

<p>"I was going to ask if you have a new job
for me to-night," interrupted Bob, "but I don't
think I care very much for your promotions.
That's where I have the best of you, Steve. If
anything happens in my department I can jump
down, but you can't jump up to get out of the
way of your troubles."</p>

<p>"At least, I am in little danger of breaking
my neck in trying to jump up," laughed Rush.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob was soon at the top of the furnace. He
was still sore from the bump he had gotten in
collision with the train of flat cars. Jarvis
walked with a limp. One leg seemed to be
shorter than the other, since the accident, but
of course this was not the case. He took up
his work with more confidence than he had begun
it on the previous night, relieving the monotony
by alternately whistling and singing,
though the latter was usually attended with a
severe coughing spell as he swallowed a mouthful
of gas and smoke.</p>

<p>Steve found his new occupation far from an
improvement over what he had begun with. His
first effort to scoop cinders and slag from the
yellow stream resulted in his losing his eyebrows,
much of the hair on his head and nearly
all the clothing he had on.</p>

<p>Had it not been for the quick action of the
man with the hose he would not have had a stitch
of clothing left on him, and perhaps very little
skin-covering either.</p>

<p>"Dip and jump!" shouted the melter. "What
are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"Principally jumping, only I didn't jump
quite quickly enough," laughed Steve, the tears
running from his smarting eyes. He bathed
them liberally in cold water, after which they
felt better.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>The next dip was not much of an improvement
over the first, except that there were fewer
clothes to be burned and no eyebrows at all.
Now, Rush was shouting for water, as had the
others before him. Being a raw hand it was
dashed over him by the pailful, in addition to
the deluge he got from the hose in the hands of
the hoseman.</p>

<p>The Iron Boy staggered away, gasping for
breath. His head was a-whirl and he felt as
though he were on fire.</p>

<p>"Water, water!" he gasped, settling down in
a heap.</p>

<p>No one laughed. No one cared. They were
used to such scenes of suffering, and the rough
furnace men felt no compassion for the suffering
boy. It was the water man's business to
cool him off and no concern of theirs.</p>

<p>In a short time Rush recovered and went staggering
to his work again. Once more he collapsed,
and once more he was brought out of
his partial faint by a pail of water and hose.</p>

<p>This kept up for the greater part of the night,
but each succeeding collapse left him weaker and
weaker. Still, Steve Rush clung doggedly to
his task. Only his iron will kept him up.
Every pore in his body was the outlet of a living
stream of perspiration. Never in his life
had he suffered the excruciating or long-drawn-out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
agony that he experienced as ladle
man this night.</p>

<p>Pig-Iron Peel nodded approvingly. He was
a rough man himself, but he appreciated pluck
and he knew pluck when he saw it.</p>

<p>"You had better lie down between casts," he
advised, grasping an arm of the Iron Boy, who
was staggering about blindly after a successful
dipping, for even in his suffering he was rapidly
getting the knack of the work.</p>

<p>"I do&mdash;don't need to," gasped Steve.</p>

<p>"I don't care. I was simply telling you."</p>

<p>The next dip was worse than any that had
preceded it. This time Steve did not need to be
told. He fell down without any effort of his
own. He simply collapsed, rolling over on his
back on the hot brick flooring of the platform,
where he lay gasping for breath.</p>

<p>A pail of water was dashed over him and the
hoseman played the hose up and down his body.
But Rush did not care. It is doubtful if he even
felt the cooling effect of the water. The boy
was too nearly spent for anything to matter.
During this wait, however, he had more time to
recover himself, and by the time the men were
ready for the next cast he was on his feet.
Steve's eyes were bloodshot, and seemed to
stand out from their sockets like two red balls.
He worked automatically for the rest of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
night, not answering questions addressed to him
and probably not hearing any.</p>

<p>"They all have to go through the same experience,"
was the comforting assurance of the
head-melter. "You will come out all right in a
day or so, if you don't die in the meantime."</p>

<p>Steve went on with his work in silence. At
the coming of the dawn Jarvis came down from
the charging platform, the whites of his eyes
looking twice their natural size in their frame
of black soot, which was plastered over the boy's
face layer upon layer. Bob found Steve leaning
wearily against a pillar. The latter's face
was drawn and haggard. Rush looked years
older. Jarvis gazed at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>"In the name of goodness what's the matter
with you? Are you going to die&mdash;are you sick, or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nothing is the matter with me," answered
Steve, the harsh lines that had grown on his
face during the night smoothing out into a wan,
but sunny smile.</p>

<p>"Well, if there isn't there ought to be, for you
are about the worst-looking object I ever saw."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you wouldn't take a prize yourself,
at&mdash;at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At a poultry show, no," finished Jarvis.
"Come along; are you going home, or would you
rather hang around here?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Home?" answered Steve.</p>

<p>"I think you will have to be carried, if you
get there to-day. Shall I go get a rig for you?
You're clean knocked out."</p>

<p>"I tell you I am all right," retorted Rush,
with some show of irritation. "Don't you
trouble yourself about me."</p>

<p>Bob gazed at his companion in surprise.
Steve had never spoken to him in that tone before,
so Jarvis kept still for a time as they went
on across the yards, over the hot metal bridge
and to the lower exit from the yards. As they
were passing out they met Ignatz Brodsky coming
in. The Pole stopped short, peering into
the face of Steve Rush.</p>

<p>"What the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Nothing is the matter with me, Ignatz," answered
Steve, by this time in better control of
himself. "I am a little tired&mdash;that's all."</p>

<p>"You stay by the house to-night. You no go
to the furnace; you go by the graveyard by and
by."</p>

<p>"We expect to, you old croaker," scoffed Jarvis.
"Go on, or else talk about something pleasant.
Where are you working now?"</p>

<p>"I work by the hot bed," answered Ignatz.</p>

<p>Bob laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"I guess we all do, though they are not exactly
beds. Well, so long; we must be going."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Brodsky bade them good-bye, Steve waving
his hand; then the Pole stood looking after
them, his eyes fixed longingly on Rush, whose
gait was none too steady. Brodsky shook his
head and went on to work.</p>

<p>"What's a hot bed, Steve?" questioned Bob.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I know a place that is hot
enough to be called one."</p>

<p>"And I know two places, the one you work
in and the one I work on top of. Do you know,
the waste gas that comes out of the top of that
stove is strong enough to light a whole town?"</p>

<p>"Goes up into the air, does it?"</p>

<p>"All that doesn't swoop down and suffocate
me. I've been asphyxiated every ten minutes
since I have been up there."</p>

<p>"I wonder why they don't use the gas for
something else?" mused Rush. He lapsed into
silence, pondering over this subject all the rest
of the way home. This was well, for it made
him forget his weariness in a measure. Reaching
the widow Brodsky's, Steve was for going
to bed without any breakfast, but Bob was so
insistent that the boy did sit down to his meal
after having taken his bath. Rush ate a fairly
nourishing breakfast and after that felt better.
This, followed by a refreshing sleep put him in
very good condition.</p>

<p>Steve left the house a couple of hours before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
it was time to go to work. He was still unsteady
on his feet, but the color was returning
to his face and his wonderful vitality was asserting
itself. He would be himself again, in a few
hours, if he were out in the open away from the
killing heat of the blast furnaces.</p>

<p>The boy wanted to see the furnaces by daylight
so, that he might get a better idea of them
than was possible in the night. He stopped to
witness the work of the day shift as they made
a cast. This was very interesting, though a
wave of pity welled up in the heart of the Iron
Boy for the suffering of the furnace men in the
terrific heat to which they were subjected while
tapping the furnace.</p>

<p>The cast over, he walked to where the huge
black stoves towered above him, and through
which the gas flamed and circulated to heat the
air that was driven in over the charge in the
furnace itself.</p>

<p>The engineer nodded to him.</p>

<p>"Where does the waste gas go to?" asked the
Iron Boy.</p>

<p>"Out into the air. Why?"</p>

<p>"I should think they would use it for something
else."</p>

<p>"What else?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Neither do I. We don't use gas for anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
else, except running the gas engines over
on the other side of the yard. I guess you don't
know much about this business, or you wouldn't
be asking such questions."</p>

<p>"One never learns much unless he does ask
questions," answered the lad. "I have learned
more from asking questions that I ever have any
other way."</p>

<p>"That's right, so long as you can find anybody
who's willing to answer fool questions."</p>

<p>Steve walked away without replying. His
mind was at work, what Jarvis called working
over time. The lad was thinking deeply over
what he had discovered, and, though he did not
realize it at the time, he had come upon an idea
that was to work a great change in one department
of the great steel industry.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="center">A HANG-OVER AND A FLAREBACK</p>


<p class="cap">"TAKE the monkey trick," ordered the
head melter when Steve reported for
duty at the usual hour.</p>

<p>This meant standing right in front of the furnace
much of the time. It was also the duty of
the monkey-man to prod the clay dam with the
dolly when all was ready for a cast, as well as
occasionally to prod through the shell of the furnace
above the metal and just below the bustle
pipes, in order to liberate the gases that had
formed there.</p>

<p>If anything, it was a worse position than he
had yet had. But Steve did not flinch. He was
there to learn all there was to be learned, and
he proposed to do so, whatever the cost to himself.</p>

<p>"I guess I can stand it if others do," he
thought when the new detail was called off.
These men were just getting ready to go to
work, Steve had stripped off a good portion of
his clothes and donned a light rubber coat when
Jarvis, who had not yet gone to the charging
platform, touched him on the arm.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"S-h-h! Look out for yourself!" whispered
Jarvis.</p>

<p>"I'm going to."</p>

<p>"When you get a chance, without attracting
attention, just look behind you and see who's
here."</p>

<p>Rush nodded understandingly and went on
with his preparations for the night's work,
while Bob started for the "roof," as he called
it. When an opportunity presented itself so
that he could do so naturally, Steve turned.</p>

<p>He gave a slight start. He found himself
looking into the face of his former pit boss,
Watski Kalinski. The latter did not appear to
have observed Steve; at least, he kept his eyes
averted until the lad decided that the fellow was
ashamed to look at him.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he is doing here?" muttered
Rush.</p>

<p>When he got an opportunity Steve asked the
head melter about it, and was informed that
Kalinski was taking the place of a man who had
been struck by the metal train on his way to
work that afternoon. Kalinski was an old furnace
man.</p>

<p>Steve nodded his understanding, but still he
resolved to keep an eye on Kalinski. He did
not trust the man, knowing well his revengeful
nature.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"Next thing I know they will have Foley over
here, and then it will be time to carry a club in
my boot, for there'll be something doing at blast
number four."</p>

<p>Nothing did occur, however. The gang made
the first cast with success. Steve still suffered
from the heat, but not to the same extent. He
was learning how to favor himself and to save
himself, a most necessary part of the furnace
man's work. Kalinski was doing general work
about the furnace, but the Iron Boy did not relax
his vigilance. As the evening wore on he
was convinced, from certain sinister glances in
his direction, that the former pit boss was contemplating
mischief. It might not come that
night, but it was sure to come sooner or later,
and the boy did not propose to be caught napping
if he could help himself. He had no idea,
however, that he would be taken so by surprise
as he really was.</p>

<p>Midnight arrived. Steve stood bravely at his
place in front of the furnace. It was heated
through and through, and the metal was running
well. Not a failure or a mishap had occurred
to mar the serenity of the head melter's temper,
and his face wore a smile when it was safe to
smile without running the risk of cracking the
smile from the heat of the furnace. During a
lull in the work Steve was asking questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
about the operation of the blast furnace. He
learned from the head melter that two tons of
ore, as it came from the mines, smelted down to
one ton of pig; that unless the ingredients were
exactly right and the boiling done just right,
thousands of tons might be spoiled in casting.</p>

<p>"You have to go by instinct largely," said
Pig-Iron Peel. "You can't lay down any hard
and fast rule. The only way is to taste of the
metal and then you know when it's done to a
turn."</p>

<p>"Taste of it?" exclaimed Steve. "Excuse
me. I have come as near to it as I want to. I'm
not a metal-taster."</p>

<p>Peel laughed.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to drink the stuff down, but
tasting with your ears, eyes and nose; hearing,
seeing and smelling&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I catch your meaning."</p>

<p>"When you get to that point you may consider
yourself a furnace man. But it is dangerous
business. A man never knows when he's
going to get his, and be dragged out in the
wagon. We don't think of it, though. A fellow
gets used to all sorts of dangers, and goodness
knows these mills are full of them. When a
fellow gets hurt, however, it's most likely his
own fault. The company does all it can to
protect its men."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I have observed. Some of its men are
more dangerous than the perils of the mills
themselves," answered Steve with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I reckon you are right at that. You're learning
the whole business, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"I am trying to."</p>

<p>"Then you've bit off a full mouthful. Going
to the open hearths from here?"</p>

<p>"I do not know; I am going wherever I am
put."</p>

<p>"That's the usual way they promote from
here, and so on into the mills themselves.
Where'd you begin?"</p>

<p>Rush told him, relating his experiences in the
pit, but mentioning no names. Pig-Iron Peel's
face grew black with righteous indignation as
he listened to the recital.</p>

<p>"Who was the fiend?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I am not going to tell you."</p>

<p>"He ought to be whaled with a red hot angle
bar, until there wasn't a piece of skin left on
him as big as a bolt-head. I'd like to get the
duffer in my hands just once&mdash;only once&mdash;that
would be enough for a starter from me. The
pup!"</p>

<p>Peel had raised his voice to a high pitch.
Steve glanced over toward Watski Kalinski.
The latter was regarding Peel and Rush angrily.
It was quite evident that either he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
caught the drift of the conversation by hearing
some of the words, or else he suspected the
truth from their actions.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd tell me who it was, Rush."</p>

<p>"No, I could not think of doing that. He has
been pretty well punished already, and he is
likely to get worse if he tries any more of his
tricks. Jarvis gave him an awful whaling, you
know."</p>

<p>Rush raised his voice so that Kalinski could
not help hearing every word this time.</p>

<p>"He did, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is Jarvis much of a scrapper?"</p>

<p>"He is a whirlwind."</p>

<p>"Good for him! I'll get him off the charging
platform and give him something better down
here," said the head melter, as he nodded approvingly
over what Steve had told him.</p>

<p>"That's the kind of a boy for me. No, I don't
mean because he fights. I got no use for a
brawler, but because he can be a man when he
gets up against the real thing. Tell me about
that mix-up."</p>

<p>This Steve did, including the kicking of Brodsky,
which really led to the interference of Jarvis.
Peel stamped about on the fire brick of
the platform, his anger growing momentarily.</p>

<p>"The whelp! The miserable cur! He'd better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
not show his face around these furnaces.
I'll break every bone in his miserable no-account
body. Tell me who he is! Tell me who he is!"</p>

<p>"Not now. Perhaps some other time. The
man might not like to hear it, you know."</p>

<p>Peel regarded his young charge suspiciously.</p>

<p>"Isn't it about time we made a cast? The ore
smells to me as if it were about ready."</p>

<p>Pig-Iron sniffed the air with a snort.</p>

<p>"Get ready for a cast!" he bellowed. "Boy,
you'll do. You've got the nose that smells,
you have. Heave up that dolly bar. How's
them gutters? You, Kalinski, there, see
that slag trough is open. Bud, get your cinder-ladle
ready. Come, now, the whole bunch of
you is half-asleep. Anybody'd think you'd been
out to a party all day long. Come, Rush!"</p>

<p>"I am here, sir."</p>

<p>"Git that dolly against the furnace dam, and
get ready to jump when things are hot enough."</p>

<p>"I will jump, never you fear," answered
Steve laughing.</p>

<p>The Iron Boy turned his back to the men and
placed the dolly bar against the clay dam after
facing the glaring heat at close range long
enough to place the end of the bar on exactly
the right spot.</p>

<p>"All ready, sir."</p>

<p>"Drive it! Steady there," warned the voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the head melter. "Keep watch, Rush, and
sing out when you get enough."</p>

<p>After a moment the compressed air drill was
put on, and after wearing the dam thin, the dolly
was once more resorted to as that could be withdrawn
much more quickly than could the compressed
air drill. Haste was necessary, or the
lives of the men would be in great peril in case
the molten metal squirted from the dam around
the sides of the dolly. The furnace men, especially
those on the tapping job, would be likely
to get the full charge in their faces.</p>

<p>"Clank, clank, clank!" sounded the steel mall
as it beat against the end of the bar held by
Steve.</p>

<p>"Tap lighter," ordered the boy.</p>

<p>The sound of the blows grew fainter.</p>

<p>"That will do. We can poke out the opening
after we step to one side. We shall then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bang!"</p>

<p>The mall struck the end of the dolly a terrific
blow. The bar was driven through the thin shell
of dolmite right into the hot metal of the furnace.</p>

<p>Like a projectile the dolly was wrenched from
the hands of the Iron Boy. It was shot through
the air, right past him at tremendous speed.</p>

<p>Steve was about to shout, "Stop it!" but he
was too late. The bar of iron was soaring out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
over the mill yard. The head melter's voice was
raised above the din.</p>

<p>"Who did that? Who hit that bar?"</p>

<p>But Steve did not hear. For a brief second
after the escape of the dolly he stood still on
the bushing. With an angry hiss a stream of
white hot metal shot past his head as though
projected through the nozzle of a hose. It was
a narrow escape, for, if the metal had struck
him in the face, it would have gone clear through
him.</p>

<p>A dull report sounded in the furnace itself.</p>

<p>"Look out for the flareback!" roared Pig-Iron
Peel. "Run for it!"</p>

<p>Now a new sound smote their ears. It was a
rumbling noise that seemed to start away down
in the foundations of the blast furnace, working
upward at a rapid rate.</p>

<p>Steve, who had quickly leaped from his
dangerous position, glanced at the head melter
inquiringly, as if to ask what this new thing
might be.</p>

<p>"It's a hang-over!" shouted the melter.
"Now we are in for it!"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="center">IN A FIERY RAIN</p>


<p class="cap">STEVE RUSH did not know what a hang-over
might be. He had just had a practical
demonstration of what a flareback
was. This, however, he did not know was caused
by an explosion of the molten metal, either from
a stream of water touching it or a too sudden
inrush of cool air. At any rate the metal in
the furnace, just as the dolly was driven in, had
suffered a partial explosion. The air was full
of molten metal shooting in all directions. Some
of the men back of where the monkey-man had
been standing had been quite seriously burned
in the explosion.</p>

<p>Steve, seeing three of them flattened on the
platform, dashed in at the risk of his own life,
dragging the men to positions of safety.</p>

<p>"Get under cover!" bellowed Pig-Iron.
"Don't you know there's a hang-over?"</p>

<p>"What's a hang-over&mdash;what am I to look out
for?" shouted Steve.</p>

<p>"That's an explosion at the top caused by a
stoppage of the vents in the charge," explained
Peel, as the two hurriedly crawled in under one
of the huge heating stoves. "It'll be raining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
coke here, in a minute, till you can't see ten
feet ahead of you."</p>

<p>"An&mdash;an explosion at the top of the furnace,
do you say?" gasped Rush.</p>

<p>"Yes. The whole business is blowing out of
the top. Don't you hear it coming?"</p>

<p>The fiery rain of coke and ore had begun. It
sounded like the roar of an approaching storm
as it beat on the metal sides of the big stoves.</p>

<p>"But Jarvis is up there!" cried the Iron Boy,
beginning to crawl from under the protecting
stove.</p>

<p>"No, he ain't. Come back! You'll be killed.
Why, you wouldn't stand any more show in that
coke shower than you would to stand up under
hot fire in battle, and perhaps not so much. Fellers
do git through a battle without being hit.
Nobody ever was in a coke shower who didn't
git more or less hit, principally more."</p>

<p>"I tell you, Bob is up there. I must go&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he ain't."</p>

<p>"He isn't? Then where is he?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he got blowed off when the explosion&mdash;when
the hang-over&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Blown off?"</p>

<p>"Sure. He couldn't hang on in a hang-over,
could he?"</p>

<p>Rush groaned. He ventured to peer from
under the stove, up into the air. The top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
the furnace was a volcano in full eruption. Fire,
smoke and coke were belching high up into the
air, there spreading out like a great umbrella
and raining down over a wide area.</p>

<p>Pig-Iron reached out a hand, jerking Steve
roughly back.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool!" he growled.</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;do you think Jarvis is killed?"</p>

<p>"Most likely. Ought to be, if he isn't after
getting that dose."</p>

<p>All at once Rush broke away from the head
melter, darted to the iron ladder, and, regardless
of the rain of coke, began running up the
ladder. The boy got blow upon blow over head
and shoulders, as the stuff beat down upon him,
but he kept his head down and pluckily kept on
up the ladder.</p>

<p>"Come back!" roared Pig-Iron, darting from
cover at the risk of his life. But Steve was too
far up the ladder to be seen from below. The
head melter again bellowed his command to
Rush to return.</p>

<p>In the meantime the boy had reached the top.
Jarvis was not there. Steve cried out to him,
but there was no response. With a catch in his
breath, Rush turned and slid down the ladder to
the base of the furnace. His head was cut and
bleeding from the flying coke, and his shoulders
were wounded in many different places.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve staggered rather than walked over to
the stove where he dropped down.</p>

<p>"Well, he ain't there, is he?" demanded Pig-Iron.</p>

<p>"No; he isn't there. Where&mdash;where do you
think he is?"</p>

<p>"Most likely out in the yard somewhere. As
soon as this black shower is over we'll go look
for him. He's done for. Too bad, but them
things will happen."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it!" answered the Iron Boy
explosively. "It will take more than a hang-over
to kill Bob Jarvis. You'll find he is all
right. But, if that is so, I don't understand why
he did not answer me when I called."</p>

<p>"I told you so. No use to cry over spilled
coke. We'll pick him up pretty quick."</p>

<p>"There, the shower is letting up. Shall we
go, now?" demanded Steve impatiently.</p>

<p>The melter stretched forth a hand, drawing
it back quickly.</p>

<p>"Not yet! I don't propose to get my head
cracked just for the sake of being in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Well, I am going, whether you are or not."</p>

<p>Rush crawled from under the stove and
straightened up. The metal was still running
from the furnace, most of it having spilled off
into the yard, for instantly the hang-over occurred
the train crew had fled. They knew full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
well what was coming, and every man of them
instantly took to cover. The metal ran over
the first ladle. Instantly the car under the ladle
caught fire. In a few minutes the whole train
was on fire. The engineer, who had deserted
his post with the rest of them, rushed back at
the risk of his life, uncoupled his engine and
started it away, thus saving the engine from being
seriously damaged.</p>

<p>Rush raised his voice in a long shout for his
companion.</p>

<p>"Bo-o-b! O-h-h-h, Bob!"</p>

<p>"Hi, hi, catch me down there!" howled a
voice from the air. It sounded right over the
head of Steve Rush.</p>

<p>Pig-Iron Peel heard it, too, and darted out.
The two men glanced up into the air. They saw
a human form shooting down one of the wire
braces that extended up to the top of the stove
to steady the metal chimney around which there
was a network of the wires.</p>

<p>"It's Bob!" howled Rush beside himself with
joy. "Help me catch him."</p>

<p>It <i>was</i> Bob, and he was descending at a rate
of speed altogether too fast for either comfort
or safety.</p>

<p>Steve leaped over to where the lower end of
the guy-wire was anchored and braced himself
to meet the shock. Peel sprang behind him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/iron4pic3.png" width="277" height="441" alt="It's Bob! Cried Steve." />
<p class="caption center extraspacebot5">&quot;It&#39;s Bob!&quot; Cried Steve.</p>

<p>"Steady, now!" warned the melter.</p>

<p>"I'll catch you, Bob."</p>

<p>"Look out!" howled Jarvis.</p>

<p>His body seemed to leap from the wire. It
landed against Steve Rush with the force of
a catapult. Steve went over like a ninepin. Behind
him Pig-Iron Peel shared the same fate,
and in an instant the three were in a tangle.</p>

<p>Jarvis was the first to extricate himself. He
leaped to his feet and began dancing about,
howling lustily.</p>

<p>"What kind of a game is this that you've
put me up against?" he yelled.</p>

<p>The boy, with arms and legs wrapped around
the guy wire, had shot down from the top of
the stove. He was angry all through, more
angry than scared or even hurt.</p>

<p>"What kind of a game is it, I say?"</p>

<p>Rush and Pig-Iron were too busy picking
themselves up from the floor where Jarvis's
bump had landed them, to make reply.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you fellows? Did
I bowl you over? Well, it serves you right if
I did."</p>

<p>"Bob," laughed Steve getting to his feet, "I
knew nothing could do you up. You're too tough
to be very badly hurt. What happened to you
up there?"</p>

<p>"That's what I've come down here to find out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
What happened down here? Was it an earthquake,
or something of the sort?"</p>

<p>"Something like that. Mr. Peel called it a
hang-over up at your end."</p>

<p>"Hang-over? Pshaw! It was a fall-over,
so far as I was concerned."</p>

<p>"How'd you git on that guy-wire?" demanded
Peel, breaking into the conversation at
this juncture. "The head of that is more'n
twenty feet from where you were working?"</p>

<p>"I took the air-line route," grinned Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Tell us what happened?" urged Steve.</p>

<p>"I was working over the top. Something all
of a sudden went wrong, and there didn't seem
to be any smoke or anything coming out. I got
up on the edge of the crater&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You mean the furnace?"</p>

<p>"I mean what I said. It was a crater, and
don't you forget it&mdash;a real, live crater. You'd
have thought so if you had seen it spit fire and
lava. Well, about the time I got up on the edge,
pouf! slam, bang! The whole insides of the
volcano popped up in my face. I must have
fallen over in, for the eruption lifted me right
out again. I did another aviation act. I spread
my planes and sailed through the air&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was that&mdash;no, of course not. Where were
you all the time from the explosion to just now,
when you came down on the wire?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was roosting on that flange up there near
the top of the stove."</p>

<p>"What? Thrown way over there?" exclaimed
Steve.</p>

<p>"No; didn't I tell you I flew again? I'm getting
to be an expert. First I flew over in the
open-hearth building and landed on a girder.
This time I tried a more ambitious flight, landing
on a hot stove. All the stuff from the eruption
fell down on me and woke me up after a
little. I nearly fell off trying to reach the guy-wire
that I knew was there. You know the rest.
I took a slide down the wire that would have
made a Japanese performer turn pale. Then
you and I had a collision."</p>

<p>"Well," laughed Steve, "it's all over now,
you can get back to work."</p>

<p>"What? Up there again?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"No, siree! Not for Robert Jarvis. He
knows when he has had enough. He can get
into enough trouble right down here on the
ground floor. He doesn't have to perch on the
edge of a crater looking for trouble. Did anything
happen down here?"</p>

<p>"What did happen?" questioned Steve, turning
to the head melter.</p>

<p>"Flare-back and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What caused it?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't rightly know&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know that your man on the rear end of
the dolly nearly put an end to me by that last
blow he struck with the mall. Whatever possessed
him to do it!"</p>

<p>"He must have misunderstood you. That
was a close call. Did the juice burn you?"</p>

<p>"It scorched my cheek a little as it went by,"
laughed Rush.</p>

<p>"What's that? Did you get singed again?"
demanded Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Yes; a little. But we must expect those
things in the steel mills."</p>

<p>"Hello, what's the matter over there?" cried
Bob, running to the edge of the platform and
looking down at the burning cars of the hot
metal train.</p>

<p>Pig-Iron explained that a flare-back had
flooded the place with molten metal, setting
everything inflammable on fire.</p>

<p>The front of the furnace had been blown out
and the platform was littered with debris, brick,
sheet-iron, metal that was still glowing and
which would continue to glow for hours before
it became cold and gray. The place looked a
wreck, though conditions were not nearly as
bad as appeared to the inexperienced eye.
There was little that could be done to clear
away until the metal had cooled.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime, the head melter had sent
one of his men to make a report of the occurrence
to the superintendent of that division.</p>

<p>"We will move over to number three. That
is nearly ready to tap," announced Peel.</p>

<p>"If you don't mind I should like to ask a
question or so before we start in," said Steve.</p>

<p>"Sure thing. What is it?"</p>

<p>"Did you see who was handling the mall when
the dolly was hit that hard blow that did the
business?"</p>

<p>"No. Why?"</p>

<p>"I should like to know."</p>

<p>"We will find out mighty quick. Say, you fellows
over there, who was plugging the dolly?"</p>

<p>"Don't know," answered a voice.</p>

<p>"It was the relief man, Kalinski," answered
another.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="center">RUSH MAKES A SUGGESTION</p>


<p class="cap">"KALINSKI!" exclaimed both boys.</p>

<p>"Come here!" commanded Peel.</p>

<p>The Pole came forward sulkily.</p>

<p>"Did you hit that dolly the whack that drove
it through the dam?"</p>

<p>Kalinski nodded.</p>

<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>"He told me to," pointing to Steve.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken. I did nothing of the
sort," answered Rush, his face flushing under
his effort at self-control.</p>

<p>"You did!"</p>

<p>"Be careful," warned Rush.</p>

<p>"You know what Brodsky would say were he
here?" spoke up Jarvis, thrusting his chin close
to the face of the Pole. "He would say 'liar!'
and I reckon he wouldn't be far from the truth
at that."</p>

<p>"Look here, what about this thing? What
are you getting at, Jarvis?" demanded Pig-Iron.</p>

<p>"This is the fellow who got us into trouble
the other time and he is trying to get Steve in
again. If he was the man driving home the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dolly, whatever he did was done on purpose.
Did he put Steve's life in danger?"</p>

<p>"Nearly killed him. So you're the duffer,
are you?" growled the melter. "Git out of
this!"</p>

<p>Pig-Iron's voice grew to a roar. He made one
leap toward the surly-faced Pole, planting a
ponderous fist squarely between Kalinski's eyes.</p>

<p>"Git up!"</p>

<p>Kalinski did not rise, for the reason that he
could not. Pig-Iron jerked the fellow to his
feet, then knocked him clear across the platform.</p>

<p>"Don't hurt him. He has been punished
enough," cried Steve.</p>

<p>"It would serve the brute right if I killed
him," roared the melter.</p>

<p>Kalinski moaned, stirred, then got to his feet
dizzily.</p>

<p>"I'll have you put out of the yards for this,"
he growled, turning slowly away.</p>

<p>Pig-Iron's right foot shot out. It caught the
Pole fairly, lifting the fellow clear of the platform,
hurling him headlong to the ground ten
feet below.</p>

<p>"There, I guess that will hold him steady for
a while. Don't you ever be caught around these
furnaces again, unless you want me to finish the
job," shouted the boss.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve's face wore a serious expression. Bob
was grinning.</p>

<p>"I wish Ignatz could have been here to see
that," Jarvis said. "It was worth being blown
off the roof to see. Say, Mr. Peel, if you ever
have occasion to lambaste Watski again, just
call to me. I want to see the fun. Wouldn't
miss it for anything."</p>

<p>"All hands to number three," commanded the
melter. "We're losing time. Daylight will be
here almost before we know it now. We have
lost one furnace full and we don't want to repeat
the performance."</p>

<p>A few minutes later a cast was being made
from number three. This time Bob worked on
the gutters while Steve continued at his post as
monkey-man, toiling in the burning heat, with
parched, cracking lips and burning cheeks.
Morning found all hands ready for home and
bed.</p>

<p>"I wish I knew whether it would be right to
see the superintendent," said Steve, as he was
walking along with Mr. Peel on the way out.</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"I think I have an idea that will perhaps make
a great improvement in the furnace end of the
business."</p>

<p>Pig-Iron laughed.</p>

<p>"Boy, there's bigger heads than yours that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
have been working on all the problems for a
long time. What they haven't thought of you
never would. But, if you think you've got an
idea in your head, just go see the super, and
get it off your mind. I know how you feel."</p>

<p>"Thank you; it isn't troubling me to that
extent."</p>

<p>Pig-Iron first went to the offices of the company
to make his personal report of the hang-over
and the flare-back that had so upset their
night's work. He made his report to Superintendent
Keating direct, as was the custom after
the formal report had been made to the division
superintendent.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating asked Peel about the Iron Boys,
whereupon Pig-Iron, in his blunt way, told the
general superintendent about Steve's plucky
fight for the mastery of himself before the
furnace and of his eventual winning out. He
told the official some further facts that interested
Mr. Keating very much.</p>

<p>About four o'clock that afternoon as the Iron
Boys were eating their breakfasts, or in this
case their dinners, a messenger called at the
Brodsky house with an order for Steve Rush to
call at the office of the superintendent before
he went to the mills to work.</p>

<p>Rush did not know what was wanted, of
course, but this time he did not believe he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
being called up to be criticized. He hurried
through his meal, and, making himself presentable,
walked over to the offices. In due time he
was admitted. Mr. Keating greeted him cordially.
He was courteous to all of his men until
they showed themselves unworthy of that courtesy.
In such cases the superintendent was curt
and brief in what he had to say and he did not
smile into their faces as he talked to them.</p>

<p>A pleasant smile wreathed his countenance
this afternoon.</p>

<p>"Your head melter has been in to-day, Rush,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir?"</p>

<p>"He had some very pleasant things to say
about you and Jarvis, in his rough way. I assure
you I was very glad to hear that you are
doing so well. I was sure you would. You have
the pluck and you will make your way to better
things, in the steel business. Neither of you
was hurt last night, were you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Peel tells me, among other things, that
you have an idea for an improvement of some
sort about the furnaces," said Mr. Keating,
with a rare twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>Steve flushed.</p>

<p>"I thought I had. He rather made fun of me
for even thinking I had an idea."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you therefore dropped it, eh?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. It is stronger than ever."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk. Do not allow yourself
to be swerved from a worthy purpose."</p>

<p>"I never do. It results in my being called
hard-headed sometimes."</p>

<p>"We like to encourage our young men to
make suggestions. Unfortunately we do not
get many of value from the rank and file. Those
men either have not had experience enough to
suggest valuable improvements, or else they are
of too low an order of intelligence to do so.
What was your idea?"</p>

<p>"It was in connection with the waste gas from
the stoves."</p>

<p>"Indeed." Mr. Keating was interested at
once.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; there is a great deal of waste gas,
is there not?"</p>

<p>"Much more than I wish there was."</p>

<p>"You buy your gas from the city plant, do
you not, if it is not an impertinent question?"</p>

<p>"We do."</p>

<p>"And it must cost you a great deal of
money."</p>

<p>"It does."</p>

<p>"Have you ever thought of any way to avoid
the waste of so much of it from the furnaces,
then?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"We certainly have, my lad."</p>

<p>"May I ask how you have tried to utilize it?"</p>

<p>"We have tried to devise some system by
which it might all be consumed in the heating
stoves. This, thus far has appeared impracticable
for the reason that, by holding it in the
furnaces we were likely to get a serious blow-out
some time."</p>

<p>"That is the only way in which you have tried
to use it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Was your suggestion along this line?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly."</p>

<p>"How then?"</p>

<p>"I may be foolish, sir, but it struck me that
the waste gas might be used to operate some
sort of machinery in the mills."</p>

<p>"Hm-m-m!" reflected Mr. Keating, not fully
catching the drift of the Iron Boy's suggestion.
"What machinery?"</p>

<p>"I visited the gas engines a few days ago, and
I was very much interested in them. I took the
liberty of inquiring how much gas was used to
run them, and when I got home I figured it
down to dollars. It came to a very large figure."</p>

<p>"You are getting into the business deeply,
young man."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I had no business to do so, but I
was interested."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on; what do you propose?"</p>

<p>"My idea is that you might run part or all
of those gas engines with the waste from your
blast furnaces, sir," answered Rush boldly.</p>

<p>"Hm-mm!"</p>

<p>Mr. Keating was surveying his caller quizzically.
Steve looked him steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>"How did you happen to get that idea?"</p>

<p>"It came to me when my friend Jarvis was
complaining about the gases up on the charging
platform. I do not know whether the idea is
of any value to you. You are welcome to it if
it is."</p>

<p>"We will discuss that phase of it later," answered
Mr. Keating, somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"You see, I have something of a personal interest
in saving money. I am a sort of stockholder
in the Steel Corporation."</p>

<p>"You are?" exclaimed Mr. Keating, plainly
showing his surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; my friend and myself hold a few
thousand dollars of the company's stock, on
which we are drawing dividends."</p>

<p>"May I ask where you got the stock?"</p>

<p>"The officials of the Cousin Jack Mine gave
us some, and with money that Mr. Carrhart gave
us we bought some more. We are going to load
up on steel with the money we earn hereafter,"
answered the boy proudly.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Keating laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"You won't buy very much on the wages you
are getting here at present," he said.</p>

<p>"No, sir; not much, but we are not always
going to work for the wages we are now drawing."</p>

<p>"You are right you are not. Let me ask how
you would get the waste gas to the gas engines.
Have you thought of that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Pipe it."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating rose, and stepping to the door
of an adjoining office, called:</p>

<p>"Mr. Phillips, will you be good enough to
come in here?"</p>

<p>The chief engineer of the mills entered the
room in response to the summons.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="center">THE CHIEF EXPRESSES HIMSELF</p>


<p class="cap">"PHILLIPS, this is young Rush, Steve
Rush."</p>

<p>The chief engineer nodded, shooting
a quick glance at the Iron Boy, after which he
fixed his eyes on the face of the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Rush and a friend of his, named Jarvis, have
come down from the mines. They are learning
the business with the intention of making it
their life work. Is that not it, Rush?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Mr. Carrhart has recommended them very
highly, and I am beginning to learn that his
recommendation was well within the facts.
These boys have heads on them, Phillips. You
are wondering what I am getting at, I see. Rush
is working on the blast furnaces. Let's see, what
are you doing there?" asked Mr. Keating, with
a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"I am the monkey-man on number four, sir,
where there was a blow-out last night."</p>

<p>An amused smile flitted over the face of Mr.
Phillips at the announcement. He was not taking
the interview very seriously, as Steve
quickly observed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"The young man has had other blow-outs,
but he bears a charmed life, I am inclined to
think. Let's see, you were blown to the roof
in the pit explosion in the open-hearth building,
were you not!"</p>

<p>"No, sir; that was Bob Jarvis."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; you were the man who was in the
other pit. I remember now."</p>

<p>Steve nodded. He did not particularly like
the personal trend of the conversation. It embarrassed
him. He wanted to change the subject,
but he knew Mr. Keating well enough to
understand that the general superintendent
must first indulge in his little pleasantries before
getting down to business.</p>

<p>"And what is more, Phillips, they are both
stockholders in the company. What do you
think of that for a couple of youngsters working
for a dollar a day?" demanded Steve's
torturer triumphantly.</p>

<p>The chief engineer smiled more broadly now.</p>

<p>"Very remarkable, Mr. Keating. Regular infant
prodigies." He was wondering, by this
time, what the superintendent was getting at,
knowing that there was some purpose behind
Mr. Keating's good-natured raillery.</p>

<p>"Did you wish me to make a place for them?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid they would not accept if you
did."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Rush has an idea that he can save us some
money. He has told me what his suggestion
is, and now I want him to repeat it to you. Go
ahead, Steve, and tell Mr. Phillips what you
have said to me."</p>

<p>This was different. It had been comparatively
easy for the boy to tell his story in the
first place, because it was backed by his enthusiasm.
That enthusiasm had in a measure
been squeezed out of him by Mr. Keating's jesting
remarks. Steve plucked up courage, gazing
straight at the now cold, inquiring eyes of the
chief engineer.</p>

<p>"My suggestion is for the utilization of the
waste gases from the stoves at the blast furnaces
across the river," announced the boy.</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Let me hear your ideas on the subject."</p>

<p>Rush began at first haltingly, then warming
to his subject as he went on, repeating very
nearly in the same words, what he already had
told the superintendent. As he progressed real
interest began to dawn in the eyes of the chief
engineer. Now and then he would halt the boy
to ask a question, but the interruptions were of
such a nature as not to disturb Steve. At last
the Iron Boy came to a conclusion.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"Beyond that, sir, I cannot go just now, not
having the requisite technical knowledge. All
that I have suggested may not amount to
much," he added with a smile.</p>

<p>"It will do very well for an apprentice,"
nodded the engineer, with a significant glance
at Mr. Keating. "What do you think about
it?"</p>

<p>"Very remarkable."</p>

<p>"You say you would convey this waste gas
to the gas engines?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Do you know where they are?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; on this side of the river."</p>

<p>"How would you get it over here?"</p>

<p>"Through pipes, of course. The gas would
lose none of its virtue in transit. It is carried
much further than that to the mills already. It
strikes me that gas from other parts of the
yards might be conveyed to the leader pipe in
the same way, and thus give you enough gas to
run your engines without having to draw
further on the city supply."</p>

<p>"How would you carry these pipes across
the river&mdash;under water?" asked the engineer.</p>

<p>"No, sir; the pipes would rust through,
would they not, and give you a lot of trouble?"</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips nodded.</p>

<p>"Your idea is correct."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should elevate them over the river."</p>

<p>"If there are any other intricate problems
that you are unable to work out, Phillips, just
call on my boys," laughed Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"Yes; I am inclined to that belief myself.
Have you an hour that you can spare, Mr. Keating?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. There is nothing more to be done
here this afternoon."</p>

<p>"How about you, Rush?"</p>

<p>"I have to report for duty within the hour."</p>

<p>"What is it you want, Phillips?"</p>

<p>"I was about to suggest that Rush accompany
us over to the furnaces, but if he has to
report for the night trick there will not be
time."</p>

<p>"We will attend to that part of it. You will
want to return home, of course, to change your
clothes before going to work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," Steve nodded.</p>

<p>The superintendent pushed a button and one
of his clerks responded.</p>

<p>"Send word to the head melter of number
four blast that Mr. Rush will not be on duty
this evening, on the superintendent's order;
that the young man is engaged on another matter
for me," directed Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>Steve's eyes glowed, not because he did not
have to work, but because there seemed reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
to believe that the plan he had so carefully
thought out was going to be seriously considered
both by the superintendent and the chief
engineer of the great steel works.</p>

<p>"That disposes of all your objections, doesn't
it, Rush?" asked Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"It disposes of the obstacles. I had no objections,"
smiled the Iron Boy.</p>

<p>"I stand corrected, sir," said Mr. Keating.
"We will start if you are ready, Phillips."</p>

<p>"As soon as I get my hat. I will join you
on the outside."</p>

<p>A few moments later they were walking
briskly along toward the yards, Mr. Keating
and the engineer together, Steve a little in advance
of them.</p>

<p>"What do you think of my young man?"
asked Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"Rush? He is a very bright young fellow.
You say he came down from the iron range?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he and his friend Jarvis, I am told,
were forging rapidly toward the front there.
They shipped on an ore boat to learn that part
of the business and then came down here to
enter the mills. From a salary of more than
a hundred dollars a month the boys are now
receiving the munificent wage of a dollar a day.
You do not need to know anything more than
that about them, do you?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; that should be sufficient to establish
their sincerity of purpose."</p>

<p>"I should say so," emphasized the superintendent.
"What do you think of Rush's proposal?"</p>

<p>"I can answer that question better after I
have looked over the ground and figured on the
proposal a little."</p>

<p>"It is a wonder we never thought of it before."</p>

<p>"It is. Still, many important discoveries
have been made by persons unfamiliar with the
subject, as against the experiments of years by
men trained to that particular profession."</p>

<p>"See here, Phillips, don't you try to throw
cold water on the achievements of my boys. I
won't have it."</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all. When I am convinced
that the boy has suggested a good thing I shall
be just as enthusiastic as you are over it."</p>

<p>"You professional men are a cold-blooded lot,
aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Do you wish to cross the metal bridge, or
to go around the long way?" interrupted Steve
halting to permit them to catch up with him.</p>

<p>"We will take the bridge," answered the
superintendent. "The hour is getting late and
we have quite a little to look over before dark."</p>

<p>Steve had already turned and was striding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
toward the bridge. As they reached it a metal
train was just approaching. The Iron Boy
halted to wait for the two men to come up,
whereupon he fell in behind them, not for any
particular reason, but because some instinct
told him to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating and Mr. Phillips were engaged
in earnest conversation discussing the plan
proposed by Steve, so that they did not take
particular notice of what was going on about
them. They were used to walking along the
narrow footpath by the side of the tracks on
the bridge that hung high over the river, so
that neither man was timid. They raised their
voices to make themselves heard above the
thunder of the hot metal train, as with its load
of red hot pig-iron, it hurried on.</p>

<p>The middle of the train was just abreast of
them when Rush's quick eyes saw one of the
big red molds swaying dangerously. This he
could not understand, for the molds were supposed
to be bolted to the cars, which was the
case with all of the molds used in the transit
of the pig-iron to the refining open-hearth furnaces.</p>

<p>Steve watched the swaying mold as the train
rolled along. Suddenly the flat car bearing this
particular mold, lurched sideways. For one
breathless instant the red hot pig of iron hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
motionless then plunged from the car. Steve
Rush was no longer inactive. The indecision
that had suddenly taken possession of him, left
him on the second.</p>

<p>"Look out!" shouted the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating turned sharply to see what the
lad wanted. He knew that some danger menaced
them, but he did not know the nature of
that danger.</p>

<p>There was no time for explanations. A second
would mean serious, if not fatal, injury to
the two men.</p>

<p>The Iron Boy darted forward. Both hands
were thrust forward, and with a mighty push
he sent the chief engineer and the general superintendent
of the mills staggering forward. They
fell flat on the narrow footpath. At the same
time Steve lost his balance and fell, right in the
path of the five-ton mold of red hot iron. Yet
the Iron Boy's presence of mind did not leave
him for a second.</p>

<p>The bar of pig struck the planking of the
footpath, went through it as if the planking
had been paper and a few seconds later, hit the
waters of the Monongahela, with a mighty
splash from which a cloud of steam rose in the
air.</p>

<p>The two men picked themselves up quickly.</p>

<p>"What is it? What does it mean?" demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Mr. Phillips angrily. "Who pushed
me? Who pushed <i>us</i>?"</p>

<p>"The boy who saved our lives," answered
the superintendent. "Don't you see what happened?"</p>

<p>"No; I will confess that I do not. Something
happened to the train, did it not?"</p>

<p>"A pig fell off, mold and all. It is down
at the bottom of the river, now, as you can see
by glancing down there at the cloud of steam."</p>

<p>Mr. Phillip's face paled. He was used to
narrow escapes, but this was the narrowest of
all in his wide experience.</p>

<p>"Is&mdash;is it possible?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"It is a wonder that it didn't derail the whole
train. We certainly should have met our finish
if that had been the case."</p>

<p>"It was a rare exhibition of presence of mind.
I never saw anything like it in my life."</p>

<p>"It was, indeed."</p>

<p>"But where is the boy Rush?"</p>

<p>"Whe&mdash;where&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;" breathed the
superintendent, his face slowly blanching. "I
declare, Phillips, he must have been caught under
the pig and carried down to his death!"</p>

<p>The chief engineer shook his head sadly, leaning
over the rail without a word as he gazed
down into the river with averted face, that his
companion might not see his emotion.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="center">RAKED BY THE "PIG"</p>


<p class="cap">"LOOK!" shouted Mr. Phillips.</p>

<p>Far down below them the head of a
man bobbed out of the water as the
cloud of steam drifted slowly away.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"There's somebody in the river."</p>

<p>"It's Rush. Where is he?"</p>

<p>Mr. Keating was greatly excited. He ran
here and there, hoping to get a clearer view of
the water.</p>

<p>"There, there!"</p>

<p>"Rush! Rush! Is that you?" he called with
hands to mouth.</p>

<p>An arm was raised from the water and waved
at them.</p>

<p>"It's he! He's safe, he's safe, Phillips!"
cried the superintendent, dancing about excitedly.</p>

<p>"Look out, Keating! What's the matter with
you? You'll have us both in the river, the first
thing you know."</p>

<p>The two gray-haired men shook hands, patted
each other on the shoulder and laughed like
schoolboys in the excess of their joy.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can you swim?" called the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll meet you on the other side," was
the reply faintly borne to their ears.</p>

<p>"Come on, Phillips." Mr. Keating started
on a run for the other side of the river, for
which Rush was swimming steadily. The banks
were high and steep on the far side, but there
was an excellent beach, so that the Iron Boy
had no difficulty in making a landing. He was
obliged, however, to go around for some distance
before finding a place to climb to the top.</p>

<p>Arriving finally, Steve found the superintendent
and chief engineer pacing up and down
the bank waiting for him. They grasped the
lad's hands, each seeking to outdo the other in
expressing their appreciation of what he had
done.</p>

<p>"But what is troubling us is to understand
how you were carried down by that pig and yet
not killed?" questioned Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"The pig did not carry me down."</p>

<p>"It didn't?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. This is the only place the
pig touched me."</p>

<p>Steve exhibited a rent in his lower trousers'
leg on the right side, and parting this showed
them a burn right down the leg. The burn
looked an inch deep.</p>

<p>"Man alive, you must get to the hospital as
quickly as you can!" commanded the superintendent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/iron4pic4.png" width="279" height="437" alt="Look! Shouted Mr. Phillips." />
<p class="caption center extraspacebot5">&quot;Look!&quot; Shouted Mr. Phillips.</p>
</div><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>
<p>"Yes, I should think I were about finished
if I had such a burn as that. The pig raked
you there, didn't it?" asked Mr. Phillips.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. But it doesn't matter much. It
smarts a little, that is all. It isn't the first time
I have been burned. Shall we go on to the furnaces?"</p>

<p>"We certainly shall not," emphasized Mr.
Keating. "You are going to the hospital and
have that wound dressed before you get it
ground full of dirt and contract blood-poisoning.
We will stop in here at Mr. McNaughton's
office."</p>

<p>Steve did not want them to give so much attention
to him. He was anxious to get to the
furnaces and talk over his plan with the chief
engineer and the superintendent. Instead, the
superintendent was at that moment telephoning
to the company's hospital, ordering a surgeon
to come to the division superintendent's
office to dress a burn.</p>

<p>The three sat down to talk while awaiting the
surgeon. Of course Steve steered the conversation
around to the plan he had proposed. Mr.
Keating watched the boy's face narrowly. He
could not understand how Rush could sit there
so calmly and indifferently with a wound such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
as he had, but the only indication that the Iron
Boy felt the slightest discomfort was a twitching
of his face, now and then, as sharp pains
shot through the wound.</p>

<p>"You haven't told us yet, how you got out
from under the pig, Rush," questioned Mr.
Phillips. "To me that was a most remarkable
escape."</p>

<p>"Not so very. I did the only thing I could
do under the circumstances. I dived through
the ties under the car. I did not dare jump in
either of the other three directions for fear the
mold would fall on me. The train was still
moving, so it was a question of taking a chance
of being run over by the train or hit by the pig.
I decided to take a chance under the train. Did
you see me drop?" asked Steve with a laugh.</p>

<p>"No; we did not."</p>

<p>"I must have made an exhibition of myself.
I turned so many somersaults going down that
I lost myself completely. It was a clumsy
tumble."</p>

<p>The two officials looked at each other wonderingly.
At that juncture, Mr. McNaughton
broke in.</p>

<p>"Here's a suit of jeans you can put on if you
wish, Rush," he said. "You look like a half
drowned hen. The jeans are clean."</p>

<p>"Thank you; I will put them on," answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
Steve gratefully. "These wet clothes feel
rather uncomfortable against the skin. I shall
have to do without underclothes until I get
home, I guess. Where shall I change?"</p>

<p>"Go in the wash room there."</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips mopped his brow after Steve had
left the room, then moved over near the electric
fan. Mr. Keating was regarding him with
an amused smile.</p>

<p>"Rather surprised you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Keating, that boy has the most remarkable
courage of any person I ever saw. It is a courage
born of his intelligence. I wish you would
let me have him in my department."</p>

<p>The general superintendent shook his head.</p>

<p>"I doubt very much if he would take the position.
As I told you, he wishes to learn the mill
business, and you and I know that there is only
one way to do that&mdash;to work like a slave, toil
from morning till night, doing the work with
one's own hands. That is the way you and I
learned the business."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you must recollect the work wasn't
the same in those days. We didn't endure the
hardships that the men of to-day endure. Do
you object to my asking Rush if he would like
to step into the engineering department?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I should be glad to see him
with you."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>Steve came out in his clean jeans, looking
as fresh and cheerful as if he had not just
passed through such a thrilling experience.
The boy's eyes were bright and his face wore
a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" asked both men at once.</p>

<p>"I never felt better, thank you," answered
Rush. "Here comes the doctor."</p>

<p>The surgeon examined the wound, shaking
his head as he finished.</p>

<p>"You had better go to the hospital and lay
up for a day. That is a bad burn, Rush."</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't think of it. Dress it right
here, and be as quick about it as you can, won't
you? I've got business on hand this afternoon."</p>

<p>"The business will keep," retorted Mr. Keating.
"You had better do as the doctor suggests."</p>

<p>"I hope you will not insist upon that, Mr.
Keating. I do not want to lie up. I shall feel
much better if I am busy, and if the wound is
well bandaged no dirt can get in it."</p>

<p>"Is it safe, doctor?" questioned the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, if nothing comes of it," was the
equivocal reply.</p>

<p>"Very well; patch him up. Have your own
way, Rush. I suppose you would do that anyway.
You are a very headstrong young man."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been told that before, sir, though I do
not intend to be headstrong."</p>

<p>"No, I understand. You just can't help it;
that's all."</p>

<p>While his wound was being dressed Steve
joined in the conversation of the officials, though
the dressing of the wound hurt him dreadfully.
Once or twice he winced, his voice hesitated;
then he went on apparently oblivious to what
the surgeon was doing.</p>

<p>None of this was lost on the general superintendent
and his chief engineer, and though Steve
Rush did not know it, he was making capital for
himself at a very rapid rate.</p>

<p>At last, the dressing of the wound having
been finished, Steve rose, announcing himself as
ready to accompany them.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to have delayed you so, gentlemen,"
he said politely.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" grunted the superintendent. "It
wasn't you, but the pig that was responsible for
the delay. You are responsible for our being
alive at the present moment. As to whether
that is a matter for congratulation, there might
be a difference of opinion."</p>

<p>The men and the boy left the division superintendent's
office laughing happily, and though
Steve Rush was a humble apprentice in the
mills, these men treated him as an equal, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
they knew him to be. The trio proceeded directly
to the furnaces. Though the hour was
late they went immediately at the business that
had brought them there. Their first work was
to examine the furnace stoves, to decide where
changes would have to be made if it were decided
to adopt the new plan. To do this all
three climbed to the top of one of the stoves.</p>

<p>"Where was it your idea to make your connections,
Rush?" asked the chief engineer.
"This might not be a bad place at the top."</p>

<p>"You know best, but I think I should begin
up here with the pipe connection, carrying the
pipe down to the bottom of the stove, with frequent
intakes. There will be no danger of fire
getting into the pipe, will there?"</p>

<p>"No; that can be guarded against, unless
there should be an explosion, against which we
cannot protect ourselves."</p>

<p>"It seems to me that an automatic valve
might be invented that would shut off the feed
pipe in case of an explosion."</p>

<p>"That is an excellent idea. Suppose you try
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am afraid I couldn't do that. I am
not a mechanic."</p>

<p>"Try it," replied the engineer.</p>

<p>The officials talked rapidly for the next few
minutes, as darkness was fast settling down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
over the yards, and the flame from the furnaces
began to cast shadows here and there. Much
of the conversation was so technical that Steve
could only surmise what the men were talking
about. At last they concluded their discussion
and started away. Steve was left at the exit
from the yards, from where he proceeded on
to his boarding place.</p>

<p>"Well, Phillips, now that we have gone over
this thing, what do you think about it? Can
it be made to work out as Rush believes it will?"</p>

<p>"Keating, it is the most practicable plan for
the utilization of the waste gas that has ever
been suggested to me. I see no reason, now,
why we should not adopt it, nor why the company
should not be saved thousands of dollars
a year through the change," was the emphatic
reply.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<p class="center">DIRECTORS GET A SHOCK</p>


<p class="cap">ON the following morning the plans of the
furnaces were taken to the office of the
general superintendent, where he and
the chief engineer went into earnest consultation.
The result of the conversation was that
draughtsmen were called in, and the plan made
as clear to them as possible, so that they might
prepare rough drawings of the proposed change.</p>

<p>These rough drawings were submitted late
that afternoon, and Rush was sent for to report
at the superintendent's office. Together the
three went over the plans in detail.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to suggest?" asked the
engineer, after explaining the drawings.</p>

<p>Steve had some slight changes to suggest, but
in the main his ideas had been fairly well followed
out by the draughtsmen. He did suggest,
however, that the action should be not
hasty; that perhaps defects would develop if
they should take more time for consideration.</p>

<p>Both officials agreed that this was wise, and
besides it was thought best to lay the whole
matter before the directors for their approval
or disapproval.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>A week passed, during which time many
changes were made and new drawings and blueprints
prepared. Steve had gone back to his
work at the furnace, where he and Bob worked
faithfully, becoming more and more familiar
with the particular branch of the steel industry
with which they were connected. The meeting
of the directors was to take place at the end of
that week, and Mr. Keating requested Steve
to be present. This Steve did not wish to do.
It seemed to him like crowding himself on the
attention of the president of the steel company,
as well as the other officials who would be present.</p>

<p>The superintendent, seeing how reluctant the
boy was to attend the meeting, withdrew his request,
as there was no real necessity for Steve's
being there. Mr. Keating had hoped to do just
what Rush did not wish him to&mdash;call the attention
of the officials sharply to the Iron Boy.</p>

<p>"You are too modest, young man," said Mr.
Keating with a laugh. "But I shall see that
you lose nothing by being so. I am going to
tell the directors plainly that you are wholly
responsible for the plan, of which none of us
ever had thought, and I am going to suggest
that you be appointed to a place worth while."</p>

<p>"Not until I have earned it," answered Steve
with emphasis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"It strikes me that you have already earned
promotion, young man."</p>

<p>"I do not mean it in that way, I mean that I
do not wish promotion until I have passed
through all the successive stages and learned
the steel business from the bottom to the top.
I expect I shall be about ready to die by that
time," added the boy, with a faint smile.
"There is a great deal more to learn that I had
the least idea of."</p>

<p>"You are making rapid progress, I must
say."</p>

<p>"If you wish to transfer me to some other department
on the first of the month I shall appreciate
the favor. I am, to a certain extent,
familiar with the furnaces and I want to keep
moving, sir."</p>

<p>"It shall be done. I had intended to do so
without your request. I am glad, however, to
have you make even a small request of me."</p>

<p>The meeting of the directors was a lengthy
one. Their interest was aroused at once when
the chief engineer rose and told them of the
plans for utilizing the waste gas from the furnace
stoves. He was assailed by questions from
all sides. The directors were progressive men,
and they quickly realized the value of the suggestion
if it could be applied.</p>

<p>The question of the cost was taken up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
this Mr. Phillips had figured down to the minutest
detail. He was enabled to tell them that,
barring accidents, the cost of the construction
and material would reach a certain figure.</p>

<p>After listening, the directors adopted the suggestions
entire. One of them rose and proposed
a vote of thanks to the chief engineer and to
the superintendent.</p>

<p>Mr. Keating was on his feet at once.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, while we appreciate your kindness
it would be unfair for Mr. Phillips and
myself to assume the credit for the plans you
have passed upon this afternoon. Mr. Phillips
will verify what I say when I tell you that the
suggestion did not come from us. Frankly, we
had never thought of it; perhaps never should
have thought of it. The credit belongs to some
one else."</p>

<p>"Who is he?" asked one of the directors.</p>

<p>"A young apprentice in the mills. His name
is Rush, Stephen Rush. The whole idea is his
own almost exactly as has been adopted by
yourselves. He is a furnace man at number
four, he and his friend, a boy named Jarvis,
also a remarkable young man."</p>

<p>"Then we must do something for this young
fellow. His suggestion is a good one. Do you
think he realizes how valuable it is?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," answered Mr. Keating with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
smile. "He was well aware of that before he
made the suggestion. It was its value to the
mills that led him to offer it."</p>

<p>"How much does he want?" questioned the
director.</p>

<p>"Nothing, so far as I know. He is not that
kind."</p>

<p>"Then I will propose," said the director
rather pompously, "that we make the young
gentleman a present of fifty dollars in gold.
That ought to be a whole lot of money for him."</p>

<p>"Oughtn't we to make it more than that?"
asked another of the board. "It seems like a
rather small sum for the service rendered, seeing
that we shall save thousands of dollars a
year by the process."</p>

<p>"No; it is a great plenty. That's the way
to spoil these young fellows. They get an exaggerated
idea of their importance."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; these boys do not," interrupted
the general superintendent, though it
was not his place to interfere. "It will take
more than fifty dollars in gold to spoil either
of them."</p>

<p>"It's enough. It is a very fine present, and
the boy will be delighted with it, you see if he
isn't."</p>

<p>The directors voted to make Steve Rush a
present as proposed by the member of the board<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
who had fixed the amount. Mr. Keating glanced
significantly at the chief engineer, and the chief
engineer glanced significantly at the superintendent.</p>

<p>It was decided that the work should be begun
at once. All the material for the purpose
was in stock in the mills, save the cement for
the concrete abutment out in the middle of the
river. It was necessary to construct this to
hold up the heavy pipe that was to convey the
gas across the river to operate the gas engines.</p>

<p>Practically all of the further details were left
to Mr. Keating and Mr. Phillips, for the two
men possessed the entire confidence of the
board, as was naturally the case. They would
not have been in their responsible positions had
they not been tried and true men.</p>

<p>The superintendent was ordered to hand
Steve Rush the money as voted by the board,
and for the purpose of carrying out his orders
Mr. Keating summoned Steve to the office after
the board meeting.</p>

<p>The lad reported. He was called in to the
private office before all the directors had left.
The president of the corporation was there, the
secretary and two directors. They looked at
the manly young fellow with more than ordinary
interest. Mr. Keating introduced Steve to
them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"What, that young gentleman a furnace
hand? Impossible!" exclaimed the president.
"Why, he appears like a man of culture and
education. I wonder how he will take the fifty
dollar proposition?"</p>

<p>He was soon to learn. Mr. Keating rose and
proceeded to express the thanks of the board
of directors for Steve Rush's great service to
the company, to all of which the boy listened
attentively, but without emotion, looking the
superintendent steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>"I am instructed by the board, Rush, to ask
you to accept a slight token of their appreciation.
Here are fifty dollars in gold that the
board has voted to you. I hope you will take
it in the same spirit in which it is offered."</p>

<p>Steve never knew whether the superintendent
meant to be sarcastic or not, but the boy was
inclined to think not under the circumstances.
Rush drew himself up, his shoulders squared
back a little further than was their wont, while
a faint color suffused his cheeks.</p>

<p>"I thank you, gentlemen, but I cannot accept
it."</p>

<p>"Not accept it?" demanded the secretary.
"Perhaps it is not enough to suit you, sir?"</p>

<p>There was sarcasm in the tone of the secretary,
certainly. His associates gave him a
glance of disapproval. Steve turned toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
him with the same steady gaze that he had
fixed on the superintendent during the latter's
remarks.</p>

<p>"Sir, were I the kind of man who was looking
for that sort of reward, fifty dollars certainly
would be considered inadequate when one
considers that the new plan will save your company
thousands of dollars."</p>

<p>The directors started back in surprise. Such
words as these, from an employ, were unusual
to say the least.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then you want more money, eh?" almost
shouted the secretary. "So that's where
the shoe pinches, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; the shoe doesn't pinch at all. I
am paid by this company for my services, paid
the same as my fellow-workers are paid. If,
in the course of my employment, I am able to
make any improvements or to suggest improvements
that will better the service, I consider
that such suggestions or improvements are
wholly the property of my employer. I am
neither entitled to nor wish additional pay for
them. Believe me, gentlemen, I should not be
backward about asking for what I thought
rightfully belonged to me. I hope none of you
will misunderstand me. May I retire, sir?" he
added, turning questioningly to Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>The superintendent nodded. Steve's bold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
stand had frustrated Mr. Keating as well as
the others. For a few seconds after Rush's departure
no one spoke; then, all at once the
president burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"That's the time you met your match, I am
thinking, Conkling."</p>

<p>"An impudent young rascal!" exploded the
secretary. "To think he would dare stand
there and insult us in that fashion. It was the
most outrageous thing I ever heard of."</p>

<p>"Wait; hold on, Conkling," protested the
president.</p>

<p>"I demand his discharge. We don't want
a man like that in our employ."</p>

<p>"Now don't get excited. Are we going to
let a monkey-man from furnace four involve
this board in a fight?" The president's eyes
twinkled merrily. He was enjoying the situation.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't care; he must be discharged."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, Conkling, he will stay.
That young man is just the kind of man we want
here."</p>

<p>The superintendent spoke with considerable
emphasis.</p>

<p>"What he says is true, Conkling, so far as the
fifty dollars is concerned," continued the president.
"Had I known what sort of boy we had
to deal with I certainly should have insisted on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
your voting him more money or else none at
all."</p>

<p>"He would not have accepted it under the
circumstances," interrupted Mr. Keating.</p>

<p>"No; that is quite evident, and I respect him
for his position. You must admit, gentlemen,
that Rush's viewpoint is somewhat unusual
these days. How much is he earning, Keating?"</p>

<p>"His wages are a dollar a day."</p>

<p>"Then promote him at once."</p>

<p>"I have offered to, but he doesn't want it.
He is working his way up, and desires to follow
the same course that any one does in going
through the mills. Mr. Carrhart is responsible
for his being here. He takes a very keen interest
in both boys."</p>

<p>"Oh, he does, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. The young men are not in want.
Each of them own several thousand dollars
worth of stock in this company."</p>

<p>"What?" almost shrieked the secretary who
had not yet recovered his equilibrium.</p>

<p>The president laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>"This is too good. Here we've been voting
a paltry fifty dollars to a man who is practically
entitled to call us to account for so doing. We
are his employs as much as he is ours. This
is too good! I shall have to tell that story at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the club," and the president indulged in another
burst of laughter.</p>

<p>No one enjoyed the discomfiture of the secretary
more than Mr. Keating and Mr. Phillips.
The faces of both men bore smiles that they
were unable to hide. The directors left soon
after that. In going out, the president approached
the superintendent.</p>

<p>"Keating, I hope you will look out for that
young man."</p>

<p>"You may depend upon my doing so. I already
have taken a great interest in both of
them."</p>

<p>"I suppose I ought to order you to dismiss
him, for if we men don't look out he'll be grabbing
our own jobs some of these days."</p>

<p>The president went away, chuckling at his
own witticism. After they had gone the two dignified
men, namely, Superintendent Keating and
Chief Engineer Phillips leaned back in their
chairs and indulged in a good laugh at the
directors' expense.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<p class="center">AN UNLOOKED-FOR PROMOTION</p>


<p class="cap">SEVERAL days later, Steve and Bob were
invited to the home of the chief engineer
to spend the evening and to take dinner
with him. They were greatly surprised at the
invitation. At the same time they were informed
that permission had been obtained from
the superintendent for them to remain away
from their work.</p>

<p>The Iron Boys were pleased, yet they did not
exactly like the idea of losing a night's work.
They were not there for social reasons; they
were at the mills for a well-defined purpose&mdash;a
purpose with which nothing must interfere.</p>

<p>The boys talked over the invitation for some
time before finally deciding to accept. Steve
thought that perhaps it were best. Mr. Phillips
had taken such a kindly interest in them.
The boys valued the friendship of the chief engineer
and the superintendent, and they were
beginning to look to the latter for advice and
suggestions relating to their personal affairs.</p>

<p>"All right; we will go," decided Rush. "Behave
yourself, Bob," he warned.</p>

<p>"Don't I always?" demanded Jarvis.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're open to suspicion, at times."</p>

<p>That night found them at Mr. Phillips' home,
dressed in their best. Their host was justly
proud of his young guests. He introduced them
to his family, consisting of his wife and two
daughters; and the Iron Boys appeared as much
at their ease as though quite used to going out
in society. They surprised even Mr. Phillips.
Bob Jarvis never had appeared to better advantage,
though he had not yet grown a fresh
crop of eyebrows since his entanglement with
the hang-over at the top of number four.</p>

<p>After dinner the boys were invited to the engineer's
library, where the blue prints of the
new plan lay spread out on a flat-top desk.
Steve recognized them at once, and he drew the
swift conclusion that their invitation there that
evening had to do with the proposed improvements.</p>

<p>Cigars were brought out and offered to the
boys, which they politely declined, whereat Mr.
Phillips nodded approvingly.</p>

<p>"There are a few questions I should like to
ask you about certain phases of this work," he
said sitting down and drawing the blue prints
toward him.</p>

<p>Steve and Bob stepped up to the desk. Mr.
Phillips asked them how they would guard
against this or that contingency; how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
men could work to advantage, and questions
that Steve Rush knew very well the chief engineer
could answer better than they possibly
could.</p>

<p>"He's putting us out on the firing line for
some reason," thought the boy. "He is getting
at something. I wonder what it is?"</p>

<p>Jarvis was beginning to arrive at the same
conclusion, for Bob was a shrewd boy, too, and
could read between the lines, if the lines were
not too close together.</p>

<p>Other questions of a similar nature were
asked, all of which the boys answered, discussing
the work intelligently and to the point.</p>

<p>From that the engineer went on to a discussion
of the mines where the Iron Boys had been
employed before coming to Steelburgh. Little
by little he drew out the story of their work
and experiences on the iron range in the north
country. He became deeply interested, and before
the lads realized that they had done so, the
story of their career, up to the present, had been
told.</p>

<p>"Then you both have had experience in managing
men?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Steve.</p>

<p>"I am glad of it, for it makes easier what I
wish to do. My invitation to-night was not
wholly without purpose."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am aware of that, sir," smiled Rush.</p>

<p>"Oh, you are, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"What is my purpose?"</p>

<p>"I am sure I don't know. I knew you were
drawing us out for some reason. I did wonder
what it was."</p>

<p>"You are shrewd. Yes, I have been drawing
you out, partly because I knew your story was
an interesting one, and also because it might
have a bearing on what I had in mind."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Would you lads consider dropping your mill
work for a time?"</p>

<p>"What to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"To help put through this new plan of yours,
to come directly to the point. When the work
is finished you may return to your mill jobs if
you wish, though I should like to make a proposition
to you to join my department. There is
a prosperous future in it."</p>

<p>Steve reflected over what the engineer had
said. There were reasons why he wanted to
accept, and others why he did not believe it
would be wise. Jarvis left the whole matter
in the hands of his companion, and he said so
when Steve asked him for his ideas on the subject.</p>

<p>"Very well, Mr. Phillips; if you think we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
shall be of any service to you we shall be glad
to aid you to the best of our ability. I am
afraid you are overrating our abilities. This
will be new work for us and the probabilities
are that we shall not make a very brilliant success
of it."</p>

<p>"I am willing to take the risk. You don't
ask what I want you to do?" smiled the chief
engineer.</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter. Whatever you think we
can do best we will gladly do."</p>

<p>"That's the sort of talk that I like to hear.
I'll tell you what I wish you to do. I am going
to make you two young men foremen in full
charge of the work, under myself and my assistant
engineers, of course. How does the
proposition strike you."</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;why, Mr. Phillips," stammered
Steve.</p>

<p>"This is so sudden," murmured Jarvis under
his breath; but the chief engineer heard
him and laughed, much to Bob's confusion.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you have given us a rather
large contract, sir," continued Rush. "Don't
you think you could find some one much better
fitted for the work than we are?"</p>

<p>"I am taking all the chances. That I am
willing to do so should be evidence to you that
I know what I am doing."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very good, sir; we shall do our best to merit
your confidence. Is there any time limit on the
work?"</p>

<p>"That is the point exactly. The work must
be done within the next two weeks. The board
has fixed that time limit. Now that they find
they will be able to save money by the new arrangement,
they are anxious to get the plan in
working order at the earliest possible day. It
is my plan to make each of you a foreman, and
to let you arrange the work to the best advantage.
How will you work it?"</p>

<p>"Work from opposite sides of the river," answered
Steve. "Jarvis on one side and myself
on the other. While the men are building
the abutment in the middle of the river we
can be running the line to the furnaces and to
the gas engine house on the other side. In the
meantime your experts can be making the connections
at each end, so that there shall be no
loss of time at any given point."</p>

<p>"Fine, fine!" nodded Mr. Phillips. "That is
a most excellent plan. It's good generalship,
and that is what counts in the battles of the industrial
world, as well as the battles between
the armed powers of the world."</p>

<p>"When do you wish the operations to begin?"</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will Mr. Keating permit us to drop our
work at the furnaces?"</p>

<p>"That has been arranged. You are free to
start in to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Is there any increase in pay for the new
work? Of course it is worth more than what
we have been doing."</p>

<p>"Certainly. You are perfectly right in raising
this question. I took it up with the superintendent
this afternoon. We decided that
twenty dollars a week would be a fair figure
for the work while you are at it. Will that be
satisfactory."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered the Iron Boys together.
"I presume you will have the men assigned
from the different departments. You see, we
do not know them and should not be able to
gather a force suited to our requirements."</p>

<p>"That has been attended to also."</p>

<p>"One other thing Mr. Phillips; you will leave
us free to get rid of any men who do not measure
up to the work, will you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Any man that you do not want
on the job, get rid of him. I think I see two
gangs working as perhaps they never worked
before," added the engineer with a smile.</p>

<p>"They will have to earn their wages, just as
we intend to do," announced Steve.</p>

<p>Mr. Phillips nodded approvingly. He considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
himself especially fortunate in getting
two such live young men to fill the particular
places to which he had assigned them. For the
rest of the evening the three discussed the plans
for pushing the work to completion in the shortest
possible time. When at last the boys rose
to take their leave they had outlined thoroughly
in their own minds what they intended to do.</p>

<p>The next morning the Iron Boys were out
bright and early. Their first work was to see to
it that the material was gotten out and put
at the proper places so as to be ready when the
work of running the line was actually begun.
The material, of course, was picked out by the
engineers, as this required technical knowledge
that Steve and Bob could not be expected to
possess.</p>

<p>At the same time a gang of men had started
in on the abutment out in the middle of the
river. All day long Steve, on one side of the
river, and Bob on the other calmly directed the
work of the men. Mr. Phillips made a trip over
the ground on both sides of the river. He was
well satisfied with his inspection. He was convinced
that he had made no mistake in choosing
his two young foremen.</p>

<p>Chainmen had run the distances and staked
them off, so that by noon the route to be followed
by the pipe line was all laid out and ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
for the detailed placing of the material. Places
where the piping had to be raised or lowered
were also marked out. Late in the afternoon
Steve and Jarvis went over their respective contracts
with blue prints in hand, fixing every detail
of the work in their minds.</p>

<p>"I think we are ready to do business to-morrow,"
said Steve as the chief engineer came up.
"Will you order the full gang to report early
in the morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that's what I wanted to know&mdash;if
you would be ready for them."</p>

<p>"We are ready for the great battle," smiled
Rush.</p>

<p>On the following morning nearly a hundred
men, all told, were working on the two sides of
the contract, including the experts who were
changing over the furnaces to make possible the
installation of the new system.</p>

<p>It was early in the forenoon when Bob Jarvis,
on his side of the river, made an interesting
discovery. There were two men working for
him who attracted his attention at once when
he got a chance to look his workmen over and
measure his force.</p>

<p>"Foley and Kalinski," muttered the boy. "A
fine pair! It does seem impossible to get away
from these fellows. They bob up in the most
unexpected places and at the most unexpected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
times." Jarvis grinned broadly. "But this is
the time the tables are turned. I'd like to see
them cut up any of their fancy tricks on this
job. There'll be music&mdash;loud music&mdash;if they
try!"</p>

<p>The two men were working side by side. Bob
strode over to them.</p>

<p>"You," he said, poking Kalinski with a stiff
thumb.</p>

<p>The Pole started up angrily, and was about to
make reply, but quickly restrained himself.</p>

<p>"I want you to go over there and help put
up those braces. You are having a pleasant
visit and I hate to break it up, but the best of
friends must part, you know. Let me give you
a little advice, Kalinski. If you know what's
best for you you will not spend much time visiting
on this job. Don't forget for a minute, that
I am the boss here, and that you are going to
toe the chalk mark every minute of the time.
As long as you are on the square you are going
to get square treatment, but the minute you begin
to travel in circles you'll fall off the earth!"</p>

<p>Bob wheeled and, walking over to Foley, delivered
much the same advice to him. After
that he saw to it that the men did not get together,
though of course he could not prevent
their doing so at the noon hour, nor was it any
of his business what they did at that time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
However, none of the crew on that side of the
river found time for visiting during working
hours. Jarvis saw to that. He kept his men on
the jump constantly.</p>

<p>The same state of affairs existed on Steve's
side. The Iron Boy was here, there and everywhere.
Nothing about the work appeared to be
too trivial for him to require his attention. The
result was that when that first day's work was
ended, the amount accomplished on both sides
of the river made the officials exchange satisfied
comments.</p>

<p>Late on the following day the abutment in
the middle of the river had progressed so far
that the iron framework that was to hold the
pipes could be put in place. Steve Rush took
charge of this. He knew nothing about iron
work, but it did not take him long to get the
knack of it.</p>

<p>As fast as a piece of tubing was braced he
would be up near the top with eyes on everything.
After an hour or so of this he returned
to the shore. Work there had not progressed
so rapidly since he had divided his oversight.</p>

<p>Rush called the men to a halt and lined them
up before him.</p>

<p>"Men, you're loafing on the job," he said.
"If I come ashore again and find that you
haven't been doing your work the whole lot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
you will be sent to the time-keeper with your
time, and you will be done working in these mills
for good and all. Do you understand? My
word goes here, and so will you if you don't do
an honest day's work. I am not going to ask
impossibilities of you, but I shall expect you to
do a full day's work. Now, fall to and get to
work."</p>

<p>The Iron Boy did not even wait to see if they
did so. He walked back to his river job. Three
hours later he came strolling back with his
hands in his pockets. Steve smiled softly. His
lecture had not been without results. The men
had done more than he had expected.</p>

<p>"Fine, boys!" he shouted. "That's the way
to do it. Now go at it! Eat it up! Don't
let the men on the other side of the river put it
over you. They can't reach your present gait,
and I know you are going to keep it up."</p>

<p>Mr. Keating was in the vicinity, though Rush
did not know of his presence, and the superintendent
dodged in behind a building after listening
to the remarks of the young foreman, then
went on his way grinning broadly.</p>

<p>"I guess we didn't make any mistake; no, we
didn't make any mistake," he repeated to himself.</p>

<p>By the end of the third day the line was laid
down to the river bank on both sides. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
began the placing of braces to hold up the piping
until it should reach out to the abutment
in the middle of the river.</p>

<p>A temporary staging had been erected to hold
the work in place until it could be permanently
located. Many of the men were working high
above the river now. Some were too light
headed to make that safe, so Steve and Bob
sent these men back to run the rest of the line
up to the furnaces.</p>

<p>Each contract was working in three sections
now, the boys having disposed their forces to
the best advantage possible, so that when they
closed that day's work their job was in good
shape.</p>

<p>Steve consulted the skies.</p>

<p>"I hope we are not going to have a storm,"
he decided. "I hope not, for I do not believe
either the staging or our construction would
stand much of a blow in its present condition."</p>

<p>After supper he went back to the yards to
look over the work, and to satisfy himself that
it was safe for the night. The moon was shining,
so he decided to go out to the abutment.
Removing his shoes the lad walked a narrow
brace all the way out. The structure trembled
under his weight, but he had no fear. He knew
that it would hold him. If it did not he felt that
it would serve him right to go down with it, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
it was his business to see to it that it was made
safe for the men.</p>

<p>Rush carefully made his way across the river.
He trod more lightly, now, that he might not
throw any more strain on the structure than
was absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>He reached the other side, stood on the bank
a few minutes, then began to retrace his steps.
He had gone about half way from the shore to
the abutment when a sound reached his ears
that caused him to halt and listen&mdash;to bend over
and peer down into the shadows below.</p>

<p>"That sounds to me like a metal saw," muttered
Steve. "It may be an echo from the shore,
but I could almost swear it was down there
somewhere about the abutment."</p>

<p>The river was so dark that he could see nothing
at all, while the structure itself was in the
bright moonlight. The Iron Boy crept along
a little further, then lay down on his stomach,
and began wriggling his way along in that position.</p>

<p>Reaching a point right over the abutment he
placed his ear to the iron and lay listening.</p>

<p>"Rasp, rasp, rasp!" The sounds were
clearly borne to his ears.</p>

<p>"Somebody is down there, as sure as I am
alive! What can he be doing? I believe there
is something going on here that I ought to know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
about. If I try to get down from here I shall
be discovered, and there will be no chance of
learning what I want to find out."</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection Rush started
back toward the shore, hugging the girder as
closely as possible to avoid discovery.</p>

<p>He reached the bank, scrambled down to the
water's edge and stood peering out into the
shadows. Not a sign of a human being could he
make out, for the river was too wide at that
point.</p>

<p>Steve hesitated not a moment. He removed
his coat, vest, shoes and shirt, binding his suspenders
about his waist for a belt; then he let
himself down into the water without making
the slightest splash.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<p class="center">CONCLUSION</p>


<p class="cap">INSTEAD of swimming straight for the abutment
in the middle of the river, Rush
headed directly up stream, keeping just a
little way out from the shore. His object, at
the time, was not apparent. It was a little later,
when, after having swum up the river some
fifteen rods, he made an abrupt turn and struck
out for the centre.</p>

<p>All this time he was swimming without making
a single splash, his hands and feet being
constantly under water.</p>

<p>Rush was pretty sure that some rascality was
going on, or he would not have gone to so great
pains.</p>

<p>Reaching a point directly in line with the
abutment the boy turned again, this time heading
down stream, floating along with the tide,
making just enough movement with his hands
to keep him on his course.</p>

<p>The abutment was outlining itself in the
shadows more plainly every minute, now, and
Steve was straining his eyes in an effort to
make out what was going on.</p>

<p>All at once the rasping sound ceased and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
saw a man straighten up and look about him.
Something bright glistened in the hands of the
man under the abutment trestle. Steve settled
down in the water as low as he could. Then
the man resumed his task.</p>

<p>"I believe he is sawing the abutment supports
down with a metal saw!" gasped the Iron
Boy. "The scoundrel! He's fixing the place so
it will go down when all the men get out there
to-morrow."</p>

<p>A great wave of indignation swept over Steve
Rush. He was so angry that, for the moment,
he nearly forgot his prudence. His first inclination
was to shout at the man over there sawing
away so industriously. But the boy quickly
realized the foolishness of doing any such thing.
His purpose was to capture the man. There
would be time enough to cry out after he had
done that.</p>

<p>"Who could do such a thing?" Steve muttered,
beginning to rise a little higher in the
water as he took wide strokes, driving himself
along at as great a speed as was possible.</p>

<p>Steve permitted himself to drift around the
side of the abutment, so that he might climb up
to it as far away from the man as possible.
Otherwise the scoundrel might get the advantage
of him. Steve's cunning was worthy of an
Indian.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the boy's fingers grasped the edge of
the abutment. He pulled himself up slowly, allowing
the water to drip from him little by little
as he rose from the river. Right beside him
was a flat-bottomed punt moored to an iron pillar.
It was in this that the man had gotten out.</p>

<p>Steve rose and listened; then, hearing no
sound, he made his way over the cement and
pieces of piping that littered the surface of
the abutment.</p>

<p>He was bothered by hearing no sound. He
wondered if the man had discovered his presence.</p>

<p>"I must be cautious," thought the boy. "I
shall get myself into a fix, and perhaps have
the whole structure down on me if I don't look
sharp."</p>

<p>A sound to the right of him caused Steve to
straighten up suddenly. He saw the figure of
a man approaching him.</p>

<p>"Stand still. I've got you!" cried the boy.</p>

<p>At the same instant he sprang forward. He
was not afraid to tackle the man. What he
feared was that the fellow would get away from
him before the boy got a chance to down him.</p>

<p>Steve's leap carried him within three feet
of his prey. The Iron Boy was preparing to
strike out hard, when something was swung in
a half circle about the head of the other man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
The object was the metal saw that the fellow
had been using for his nefarious purpose. It
caught Steve a blow on the side of the head,
lifting the boy from his feet sideways and dropping
him to the abutment. As he fell, Rush,
who was not knocked senseless, fastened about
the ankles of his enemy with both arms.</p>

<p>The result of this move was that the man went
over too. He toppled over backwards with
Steve holding to him tightly. In an instant the
two were fighting desperately. Blows were
struck on both sides; breaths came short and
sharp.</p>

<p>All at once the support slipped from beneath
them and the two fighters rolled over into the
river, where the battle was continued with renewed
vigor. But Rush had been weakened
somewhat by the blow from the metal saw and
was not at his best.</p>

<p>"You villain!" he shouted. "I've got you
now. I've&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>A blow on the side of the jaw caused the Iron
Boy's head to droop to one side. One more
swift blow, and he dropped limply from the
arms of his adversary. With a growl of triumph
the man started to swim away. Steve drifted a
few yards struggling manfully to regain his
senses, which he did in a measure a few seconds
later, though his body seemed to be numb<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
from head to feet. The lad managed to get his
hands over the edge of the small boat as he
drifted alongside of it. Off on the river he
could hear the fellow splashing toward shore.</p>

<p>"Help!" shouted Steve. "Catch him!"</p>

<p>He hoped some one might hear his voice and
capture the escaping man. As it chanced some
one was on shore, and that some one was Bob
Jarvis, who, learning at the house that Steve
had gone down to the works, followed on. He
was standing there when Steve called, and he
was on the bank peering down when the man
came splashing ashore and started to run away.</p>

<p>Bob grabbed the fellow by the collar.</p>

<p>"Hold on, old man, what's doing around
here! What&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The stranger launched a blow at Jarvis,
whereupon Bob knocked the man flat on his
back.</p>

<p>"Police!" shouted the boy. Three Iron and
Steel Police came running to the scene. "Take
this man into custody! He's been up to some
deviltry. Hello, I should say so. It's that fiend,
Kalinski. I'll make a charge against him after
I find what he has been up to."</p>

<p>Shaking Kalinski, Jarvis demanded to know
if he had seen Rush, but the Pole would not
answer a word. Bob got a boat and hurried
out to the abutment after seeing Kalinski safely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
in the hands of the police. As Jarvis neared
the abutment, calling out the name of his companion,
he heard Steve's faint answer.</p>

<p>"I knew it, I <i>knew</i> it!" fairly shouted Bob.
"That scoundrel has been doing Steve up! Oh,
I ought to have wrung his neck while I had the
chance!"</p>

<p>Rush was quickly taken ashore; and, accompanied
by Bob, went to the police station and
made the charge against Kalinski. The engineer
was routed out, and an examination was
quickly made of the foundation. It was found
that Kalinski had partially sawed in two, half
of the uprights that held the framework, so that,
with additional weight upon it, the structure
would have collapsed. The men were called out
at once. There was no sleep for the Iron Boys
that night. By daylight the work had been
shored up and made safe for the time being.</p>

<p>The boys were highly complimented for their
vigilance, though by some miscarriage of justice,
Kalinski got off scott-free and quickly disappeared
from the mills.</p>

<p>As for the contract, Steve Rush and Bob
Jarvis pushed it along with renewed vigor. By
this time the men had come to like their young
overseers and all worked at high pressure. The
result was that the contract was finished some
days before the time named by the officials, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Steve, proud and happy, had the pleasure of
seeing the plan that was the product of his own
brain put into successful operation.</p>

<p>Bob and Steve still continued to board at
the Brodskys. On the strength of Steve's
recommendation, Ignatz received a promotion
and an increase in wages. The bestowal of this
mark of favor upon her son caused Mrs. Brodsky
fairly to worship the Iron Boys, and Ignatz
became their devoted shadow.</p>

<p>A few days after finishing their contract the
boys were detailed to the open-hearth furnaces,
where they were promoted to melter's assistants.
This sounded much better than it really
was, for the boys were to face another trying
experience there. In fact, they were destined
to face many trying experiences in other parts
of the mills ere they had completed their education
amid the roar of the ponderous machinery,
the thunder of the giant cranes and the
deafening reports of exploding metal.</p>

<p>But all this will be told in a following volume
entitled, "<span class="smcap">The Iron Boys on the Steel Rail

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
